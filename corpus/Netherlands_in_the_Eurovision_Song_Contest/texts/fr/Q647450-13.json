He is a great composer, maybe the biggest of our country.\" Kartner was awarded as such by the Dutch Top 40 association.\nIn 1977, Kartner was asked to write a promotional song for an animated movie, which turned out to be about The Smurfs. The record company pressed 1,000 copies, since they were unsure about the success of the single. However, they were all sold within one day at a Schlager festival. After a repress, 400,000 singles where sold in a short period. A full Smurfs album (LP) was then created, which also climbed the charts, with 500,000 sold copies. People in other countries also started to notice the catchy tune, and it was released in several countries, in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Japanese, all sung by Kartner himself. He scored a number one hit in 16 countries. Altogether, his 'Smurf' works have about 30 million sold copies (source: Wikipedia).", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/story/pierre-kartner-to-write-dutch-entry-in-dutch", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093420/https://eurovision.tv/story/pierre-kartner-to-write-dutch-entry-in-dutch", "a_id": "Q647450-13"}
