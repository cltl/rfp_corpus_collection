While waiting for her \u201cnext album\u201d, the singer unveils the song \u201c365\u201d to \u201csay thank you\u201d to the public who changed her life thanks to Eurovision. Thus, the singer makes a comeback in music on her crazy year.\n\u201cI love you and I owe you everything\u201d\nSince then, Barbara Pravi has shared her good humor and her beautiful songs with the public. She travels through television sets and concert halls in France but also in the Netherlands, Poland and Lithuania.\nIndeed, the Victoire de la Musique that she won last February in the Female Revelation category is a turning point for the singer. It is therefore a dizzying year that the 29-year-old musician has just experienced. An intense period which she takes stock of on her new song \u201c365\u201d.\nBarbara Pravi writes on her Instagram account, both anxious and impatient:\n\u201cMy birds of paradise, it\u2019s been almost a year since I released a song, I\u2019m stressed as if it were the first time! \u00bb Barbara Pravi on Instagram\n\u201cI need you more than ever for it to exist, your massive sharing, your words and your love, because I take it out \u2018in the wind\u2019, hoping that it will take it to the windows of your houses and apartments. Or more directly into your hearts\u201d. Barbara Pravi on Instagram\nThis song, she says, was written \u201cto you, for you\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s to say thank you, to say see you soon before the next album. (\u2026) I love you, I love you and I owe you everything, thank you. Every time I go on stage my heart is filled with gratitude and recognition: you have changed my life. May all the 365 days that will pile up in my existence lead me to see you, to sing you life, music and love and to love us again\u201d Barbara Pravi\nConcludes Barbara Pravi, proud to present this title \u201c365\u201d both full of energy and sweetness, with strings that twirl on the chorus.\nIn this title, Barbara Pravi shows that she has a super versatile voice, capable of going from a more \u201cspoken\u201d tone to very sung, even shouted highs. Thereby, she contemplates the mistakes that made her move forward, and the \u201cI love you\u201d from the public that changed everything. You will therefore have understood, after a short saving break, Barbara Pravi will start writing her second album!\nBarbara Pravi at Eurovision\nWhat a long way for Barbara Pravi since the crazy adventure of Eurovision! The singer was selected by France 2 viewers to represent the country with her song \u201cVoil\u00e0\u201d for the 65th edition of the competition. The artist amazed the whole of Europe with her bewitching ballad.\nShe achieved the best score for France since 1991. She finished 3rd in televoting, making her second in the contest behind Maneskin, with a total of 499 points.\nA nice revenge for the singer after years of struggling to write songs in the shadows for other artists. She was able to compose for Carla (\u201cBim Bam Toi\u201d) or even the winner of Eurovision Junior 2020, Valentina, without being able to be heard.\nHowever, the artist leaves with two awards named in honor of Marcel Bezan\u00e7on, the founder of the competition. These are the Press Prize, awarded by accredited journalists, and the Prize for Best Artistic Performance, based on a vote by commentators.\nHave you listened to her new single yet?
