Da\u00f0i has spoken about his desire to win the entire contest:\n\u201cThis is a competition so we have the mentality to win this. Most emphasis is placed on advancing to the finals so that there can be a good party here on Saturday. I do not see the whole point of competing in a competition if you do not intend to see if you can win.\u201d\nDa\u00f0i and his team are currently working on preparations. The song, which features a choir made up of submissions from the Internet, will be finalised in the next few days, costumes and staging will be prepared. A music video will be also be filmed, which will be released at the end of March. There will also an accompanying video game where Da\u00f0i and Gagnamagni\u00f0 will play a key role.\nDa\u00f0i says that it is a different feeling to compose a song that he knows will be the Icelandic entry:\n\u201cWe know that we are going into the real competition so it can be justified to put everything into this. I have a lot ready that I did not have last time. You can plan things further ahead instead of going to the national final without knowing if we will continue on to Eurovision.\u201d\nIn the lead up to the song reveal, R\u00daV will broadcast a two-part documentary about Da\u00f0i Freyr and Gagnamagni\u00f0 on February 27 and March 6.

The contest is incredibly popular in Iceland, regularly being one of the most watched programmes of the year. Iceland has yet to win the contest but has finished in 2nd on two occasions. In 1999, Selma missed out on victory in Jerusalem by 17 points, and in 2009 Yohanna became the most successful Icelandic entrant ever finishing 2nd in the final with the song \u201cIs it True?\u201d. She scored 218 points, yet still finished 169 points behind the runaway winner Norway.", "original_url": "https://eurovoix.com/2021/01/27/iceland-eurovision-2021-entry-to-be-revealed-on-march-13/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127134147/https://eurovoix.com/2021/01/27/iceland-eurovision-2021-entry-to-be-revealed-on-march-13/", "a_id": "Q31749372-39"}
