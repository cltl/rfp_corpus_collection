In 2017, he took part in Poland\u2019s national selection with \u201cSky Over Europe\u201d and finished second behind the winner Kasia Mo\u00c5\u203a. In 2020 Rafa\u00c5\u201a hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in Poland. He also was one of the jury members of the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. His favourite was Australia\u2019s \u201cZero Gravity\u201d.\nLast year Poland was set to be represented by Alicja Szempli\u00c5\u201eska, who won their national selection Szansa na sukces with her song \u201cEmpires\u201d. After the contest was cancelled, Alicja expressed her desire to represent Poland in 2021.\nPoland at the Eurovision Song Contest\nPoland first debuted Eurovision in 1994, with the fabulous Edyta G\u00c3\u00b3rniak and her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTo nie ja!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. To this day, that remains as Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best ever placing in Eurovision, with them only reaching the top 10 twice since then (most recently in 2016 with Micha\u00c5\u201a Szpak and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcColor of Your Life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122).\nBetween 2005 and 2011, we only saw Poland in one Eurovision grand final \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in 2008 with Isis Gee and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFor Life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In the last three years, Poland has again failed to qualify for the final \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in 2019, Tulia missed out by only three points.\nWill you support Poland at Eurovision 2021? Let us know!
