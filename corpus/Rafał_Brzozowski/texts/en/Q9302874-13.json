His other TV work includes the popular music show The Name of the Tune and his time as co-host of the Polish version of Wheel of Fortune.\nRAFA\u0141\u2019s music career started with his participation in The Voice (of Poland), releasing his debut single Tak blisko (\u201cSo Close\u201d) shortly after. Riding high in the Polish airplay and sales charts, the entertainer found further success with his albums Tak blisko and M\u00f3j czas (My Time).\nMusic aside, Brzozowski\u2019s two biggest passions are sports and aviation. Rafa\u0142 won a bronze medal for his wrestling in the Academic Championships of Poland, and is currently working on upgrading his private pilot licence to an aerobatic licence.\nPerhaps Rafa\u0142 could fly to Rotterdam and offer the nearby Czech, German and Danish participants the opportunity to join him on The Ride?", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/participant/rafal-2021", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210313021237/https://eurovision.tv/participant/rafal-2021", "a_id": "Q9302874-13"}
