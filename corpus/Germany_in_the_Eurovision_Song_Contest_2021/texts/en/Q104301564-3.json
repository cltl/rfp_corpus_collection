The Dutch city was due to host the Contest in 2020 before the event was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Semi-Finals will take place on 16 and 18 May 2021. The Grand Final takes place on 22 May 2021.\nIn the coming months it will be decided which elements of the 2020 edition of the show will remain in 2021. \"The stage will be carried over to next year, because that was already prepared. Apart from that, a lot depends on what is possible at that time, on the availability of all those involved and on what fits the spirit of 2021\" said Sietse Bakker, Executive Producer of the show.\nThe venue for the 2021 Contest will, like in 2020, be Ahoy in Rotterdam. The venue has hosted several big events, including the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2007.", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/event/rotterdam-2021", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200702011904/https://eurovision.tv/event/rotterdam-2021", "a_id": "Q104301564-3"}
