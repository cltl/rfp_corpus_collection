However, Lesley, 33, has signalled she could be \u00adIreland\u2019s entry next year.\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with RTE and we agree that I will 100 per cent come back as long as the song is big enough and catchy enough.\n\u201cSo if I can write something to the standard, we all agree, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\nAnd the Balbriggan woman \u2014 who was due to sing The Story Of My Life \u2014 is already thinking about the new track.\n\u00adLesley explained: \u201cI\u2019m taking a lot of the lessons from the experience of the last few months. The stuff that went down well with Eurovision fans and what they didn\u2019t like.\n\u201cI want to take all those notes with me when I get back in the studio.\u201d\nHaving been tipped as a potential winner this year, New York-based Lesley says she has unfinished business.\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019d like to finish the process. It\u2019s strange not to have done the show so \u00adhopefully all the artists can make their way back their next year. I\u2019d love to do that. It\u2019s a dream of mine.\u201d\nNext year\u2019s Eurovision will still be held in Rotterdam, in May. And Lesley says getting there will complete a lifetime of Eurovision memories.\nMOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ HOW SHE DOES Rita Ora bares all as she goes topless to show off her pride makeup routine MR & MRS Ruth Langsford praises romantic Eamonn Holmes as he spoils her on 10th anniversary HAZ-MAT!
