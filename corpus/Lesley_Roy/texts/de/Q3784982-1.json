It was a very big event in my house every year, we watched and voted on each act and I became a massive fan at a very young age. I\u2019m very lucky that I am from the era of Niamh Kavanagh, Paul Harrington, Eimear Quinn, Riverdance years,\" Lesley said.\n\"I feel like the back to back years watching it live from the Point Depot with Gerry Ryan hosting and the explosion of Riverdance left a very deep impression on me as a kid. I definitely made a mental note that this is something I would love to do for Ireland when I grew up. I think I have a very high standard of what a Eurovision song should be because of those memories and that definitely informed the type of song I would send.\" Of her Eurovision ambitions for Rotterdam 2020, she added: \"My mindset for the coming months is to train, rehearse, prepare, perform, execute and hopefully bring Eurovision glory back to Ireland once again.\"\nIreland in Eurovision\nIreland first entered the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965 and still holds the record for most Eurovision wins, with a tally of 7 victories at the Contest.\nIreland famously won 4 out of 5 contests in the 1990s and became the first country to win 3 times in a row.\nDo you think that Lesley Roy will be able to take Ireland to the Grand Final on 16 May?
