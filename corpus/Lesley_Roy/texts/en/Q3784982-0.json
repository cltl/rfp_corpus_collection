{"title": "The Buzz on Lesley Roy", "text": "The Buzz on Lesley Roy\nIn addition to the odd pairing of teen dreams the Jonas Brothers, beer-buzz-happy Shwayze, Nelly and his pro-partying stance, and scary Slipknot, tonight\u2019s FNMTV lineup also holds a relative newcomer \u2014 21-year-old Irish singer-songwriter Lesley Roy. Think Amy Lee\u2019s best friend meets Gretchen Wilson\u2019s little sister meets Hayley Williams\u2018 Irish cousin over a pint of Guinness.\nWe rang up Lesley in L.A., where was prepping for her big FNMTV debut, and she gave us a little look (as much as one can over the phone anyway) at her about-to-drop video, \u201cI\u2019m Gone, I\u2019m Going,\u201d off her upcoming album, Unbeautiful, which hits stores September 30th and features songwriting credits by FNMTV alum Katy Perry. Wait, so, did Katy put the girlie moves on Lesley? Read our exclusive interview with Lesley Roy to find out.\nBuzzworthy: What can we expect to see in your new video, \u201cI\u2019m Gone, I\u2019m Going\u201d?\nLesley Roy: It\u2019s definitely about where I am in my life. For the past two years, I was going back and forth to the States, and I finally made the move, and I\u2019m releasing the album, and it\u2019s all coming together now. So \u201cI\u2019m Gone, I\u2019m Going\u201d is 100 percent what I\u2019m doing right now. I can\u2019t wait to show it Friday night!\nBW: Why\u2019d you title your upcoming album Unbeautiful?\nLR: Unbeautiful is the title of one of my favorite songs on the album. I called the album that because it\u2019s when I hit rock bottom. It\u2019s the question a lot of people ask when they\u2019re in a relationship, and it\u2019s like \u2018where was the point where you didn\u2019t find me attractive anymore?\u2019 It\u2019s a universal feeling and an unusual word. A lot of people ask me about it and relate to it. And the world is not perfect right now. Unbeautiful seems like a realistic title for a lot of things that are happening.\nBW: You worked with a lot of different songwriters and artists on this album. Will any guest artists end up on the album?\nLR: My first album is just gonna be me, but on the second one i wouldn\u2019t mind doing a duet or two with some male artists like Chris Daughtry \u2014 I think our vocals would work well together.\nBW: You also worked with Katy Perry on this album!\nLR: I did indeed! I worked with Katy on a song called \u201cSlow Goodbye.\u201d We had great fun. She\u2019s a great writer, great girl. We get along great together. Her album\u2019s doing amazingly right now. I\u2019m so proud of her!\nBW: Did she try to kiss you?\nLR: Ha! No, she didn\u2019t!\nBW: Okay, just checking, because she was just in the news saying she wanted to kiss Miley Cyrus.\nLR: I think she wants to kiss a different artist every week. She\u2019s so funny. I love her! Katy Perry rocks.\nBW: Besides the premiere of your video, what part of FNMTV are you most excited about?\nLR: I\u2019m excited to talk to Pete! This is huge for me! It\u2019s my first live TV. I\u2019ve done stuff at home in Dublin, but it\u2019s my real introduction to America, and I\u2019m doing my video, and it\u2019s live. I\u2019m nervous but excited. I\u2019ve been keeping busy practicing with my band a lot, but at night I\u2019ve been thinking \u2018Oh God! I\u2019m on MTV on Friday! What the hell am I gonna say?\nFind out when Lesley Roy \u2014 and her video, \u201cI\u2019m Gone, I\u2019m Going\u201d \u2014 makes her FNMTV debut, listen to \u201cI\u2019m Gone, I\u2019m Going\u201d here, and see what else we\u2019ve got planned tonight on FNMTV.", "original_url": "http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2008/07/18/fnmtv-sneak-peek-the-buzz-on-lesley-roy/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080915052101/http://buzzworthy.mtv.com:80/2008/07/18/fnmtv-sneak-peek-the-buzz-on-lesley-roy/", "a_id": "Q3784982-0"}
