{"title": "Eurovision Song Contest", "text": "Eurovision Song Contest\nDescription\nEBU coproduction\nThe Eurovision Song Contest (the \" ESC \") is an international coproduction by broadcasting organisations having the status of Members of the EBU, as defined under the EBU Statutes (the \" Members \") which is carried out under the auspices of the European Broadcasting Union (the \" EBU \") as part of the television programme exchange known as Eurovision.\nA maximum of 46 Members shall be allowed to participate (the \" Participating Broadcasters \"). Members from a maximum total of 26 countries shall compete in the Final. There shall be six guaranteed places therein (i.e. one for the producing organization (the \" Host Broadcaster \"), five EBU Members from France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom). Subject to a decision by the EBU in consultation with the Reference Group, the number of guaranteed places in the Final may be modified depending on circumstances. Apart from the six broadcasters with guaranteed places, all Participating Broadcasters from a maximum of 40 countries shall compete in one of the Semi-Finals for the remaining places in the Final.\nContent\nThe ESC is composed of three live Shows, two Semi-Finals usually taking place on Tuesdays and on Thursdays and one Final taking place on Saturdays. The Shows are produced and transmitted live by the Host Broadcaster (see the Event Schedule) and are made available over the Eurovision satellite network for live broadcast by the Participating Broadcasters.\nEach Show is a state-of-the-art, world-class television production and consists chiefly of successive live televised performances of songs by artists entered by the Participating Broadcasters to represent their countries. Each song which competes in the ESC shall be selected through a national selection to be organized by each Participating Broadcaster. The national selection is organized under the sole responsibility of the Participating Broadcaster in question.\nThe main title of the Shows is the \"Eurovision Song Contest\", followed by the year during which it takes place. It shall be used by all broadcasters, although they may instead use a translation into their national language, subject to the approval of the EBU Permanent Services. If the translation is approved, the main title need not be used. Broadcasters are also permitted to include a minor title under the main title, using the name by which the ESC has been known in recent years in their respective countries.\nThe allocation of the countries to the two Semi-Finals and the position of appearance of the Host Broadcaster in the Final shall be decided by means of draws organized by the Host Broadcaster. The Shows are presented on stage, in both English and French, by the international presenters. National commentary by commentators appointed by each of the Participating Broadcasters is added to the international version of the Shows for broadcast in their respective countries.\nDetermination of the scores and of the winning song\nViewers in the countries of the Participating Broadcasters are invited to vote for their favourite songs (without the possibility of voting for the song representing their own country) by means of televoting (votes of the National Audiences), which shall be implemented in all the countries of the Participating Broadcasters.\nIn addition, in each participating country, there shall be a National Jury to be appointed by that country's Participating Broadcaster to vote in the Semi-Finals and in the Final in accordance Section 1.3 below.\nWith respect to the National Jury, the jury members shall rank first their favourite song, second, their second favourite song, third, their third favourite song, and so on until their least favourite song which shall be ranked last. Abstentions are not allowed, except that the song representing the country of the Participating Broadcaster which has appointed the National Jury shall be excluded from the vote. In both Semi-Finals and in the Final, the results of the National Jury in each country shall be determined as follows:\n12 points shall be allocated to the song having obtained the best rank from the National Jury;\n10 points to the song having obtained the second-best rank from the National Jury,\n8 points to the song having obtained the third-best rank from the National Jury,\n7 points to the next,\nand so on, down to 1 point for the song having obtained the tenth-best rank from the National Jury.\nWith respect to the televoting, in each country, the song which has received the highest number of votes shall be ranked first, the song which has received the second highest number of votes shall be ranked second and so on until the last song and the points shall be attributed using the same methodology as mentioned above.\nThe points of the National Juries and of the National Audiences shall be combined according to a ratio which is determined by the EBU, subject to the Reference Group approval.\nFor example, if the ratio is 50-50, the points of the National Jury carry the same weight as the points of the National Audiences. Once all the songs have been performed, the results shall be announced.\nIn the Semi-Finals, the international presenters shall announce the names of the countries which have qualified from the Semi-Finals for the Final.\nIn the Final, the results of the National Juries in each country shall be announced in turn by the spokesperson of each Participating Broadcaster, clearly and distinctly in English or in French (stating first the name of the country concerned and then the points allocated by the National Jury to the songs, in ascending order).\nOnce all the spokespersons have announced the results of their National Juries and before the televoting result of the National Audiences is revealed, the complete results of the National Juries appear on the scoreboard. Therefater the televoting results of the National Audiences for each song across all participating countries shall be added progressively to the scoreboard. The televoting results of the National Audiences are therefore announced by the International Presenters, starting with the country receiving the fewest points from the televoting and ending with the country receiving the highest number of points. The televoting points from the National Audiences from all participating countries will be combined with the points of the National Juries, providing one combined score for each song At the end of the process, the International Presenters shall announce the winner.\nThe exact way of presenting the results during the Shows and/or calculating the points shall be decided in common agreement between the Host Broadcaster and the EBU Permanent Services and subject to the approval the Reference Group.\nThe respective winners of the Semi-Finals and of the Final shall be the song(s) which, according to all information made available to the EBU Permanent Services by the pan-European televoting partner , has/have obtained the highest combined number of points once the results of the National Audiences and of the National Juries have been added at the time of announcement of the results.\nThe song writer(s), artist(s) and Participating Broadcaster of the winning song(s) in the Final shall receive the ESC Trophy, and the transmission of the Final shall end with a further performance of the winning song(s).\nThe full results of the televoting of the National Audiences and of the voting of the National Juries in the Semi-Finals and the Final shall be published on the official website of the ESC, www.eurovision.tv , after the end of the Final and such results may be made available on National Websites of the Participating Broadcasters.\nCriterea of eligibility\nSongs\nThe compositions (lyrics and music) must not have been commercially released before 1 September 2016.

Implementation of the compulsory televoting shall not exempt any Participating Broadcaster from appointing a National Jury.\nNational Juries shall vote in all countries and in all cases.\nThe votes of the National Juries shall be used (i) in case of a technical or similar failure in the televoting procedure, (ii) in all cases, for calculating the ranking of the songs in the Semi-Finals and in the Final and (iii) to solve a tie situation should two or more songs receive the same number of points from theNational Audience.\nThe EBU Permanent Services shall decide during the Semi-Finals and the Final whether only the National Jury votes shall be used.

It shall cooperate with the EBU and the independent auditor in connection with all matters regarding National Jury voting.\nProcedure in case of a tie\nShould there be a tie for the last position in a Semi-Final (because two songs have received the same number of points) or for the first place in the Final, as well as any other situation where a tie occurs after the points from the result of the televotes (National Audiences) and the National Juries have been combined to determine the final ranking, the winner shall be the song which has obtained the highest rank from all the National Audiences. The song that received the most points from all the National Audiences is ranked the highest. Should there be a tie, because two songs have received the same number of points from all the National Audiences, the winner shall be the song which has obtained points from the highest number of National Audiences. If the tying songs have received points from the same number of National Audiences, the highest number of 12-point scores shall be decisive. If the winner still cannot be determined by this procedure, the number of times ten points have been awarded shall be the deciding factor. If necessary, this method shall continue until account has been taken of the number of times one point has been awarded.In the very unlikely case that after applying the above procedure there is still a tie, the tie shall be resolved by giving precedence to the country which was earlier in the running order for the Show concerned. Respectively the same procedure shall be used to resolve any tie in the points from all the National Juries of the participating countries.\nShould two or more songs receive exactly the same number of points from the National Audience in a given country, the results of the National Jury shall be used to determine their respective ranks (i.e. the song having obtained the best rank from the National Jury shall be ranked highest).\nShould two or more songs receive exactly the same rank from a National Jury, the order shall be ascertained by a show of hands by the members of the National Jury.\nEBU's rights and obligations\nThe EBU is in exclusive control of all centralized marketing and exploitation of the ESC.\nDistribution & licensing\nWithout prejudice to the other rules in this Section, all broadcasting and other rights to the Shows and the ESC are exclusively owned by the EBU, to be managed centrally by the EBU on behalf of the Participating Broadcasters.\nThe EBU Permanent Services shall, in cooperation with an agent if needed, be responsible for coordinating all sales of the Shows (including any ESC content produced by the EBU), in whole or in part, to non-participating broadcasters from countries where rights remain available and to third parties, for the financial benefit of Participating Broadcasters and the Host Broadcaster.\nUnless any rule in this Section applies, non-participating broadcasters are not allowed to broadcast any material from the Shows (rehearsals/preparations, etc.) without the prior written permission of, and without possible payment of a rights fee to, the EBU.\nRadio\nRadio organizations (other than Members) from countries where rights remain available, may acquire the right to broadcast the Shows on their territory against possible payment of a rights fee.\nRadio broadcasters shall not be entitled to sell any sponsorship package in relation to the ESC and/or in relation to their transmission of the Shows.
