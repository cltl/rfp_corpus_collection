U.S. chart, spurred by Italy\u2019s Sanremo Music Festival. The event, held March 2-6, acts as Italy\u2019s qualifying competition for the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest. And as the Sanremo festival unveiled the country\u2019s first taste of this year\u2019s international competition, those four Italian debuts were simply an appetizer before the entr\u00e9e. On the June 5-dated lists, seven Eurovision finalists debut across the Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. chart.\nThirty-nine countries participated in this year\u2019s Eurovision tournament, held May 18-22 in Rotterdam, Netherlands, after the 2020 edition was canceled due to COVID-19. After a slew of regional qualifiers and international semifinal rounds, Italy was declared the winner, represented by M\u00e5neskin\u2019s \u201cZitti E Buoni.\u201d\nThe Italian quartet\u2019s track makes its second appearance on the global rankings, after first reaching No. 106 on the Global Excl. U.S. chart following Sanremo in March. This week, it re-enters at No. 11, while debuting on the Global 200 at No. 26. It tops all Eurovision finalists in both streams (30.1 million, up 869%) and sales (10,600, up 2,942) worldwide in the week ending May 27, according to MRC Data.\nM\u00e5neskin brought home Italy\u2019s first Eurovision win since 1990, and the first win for a group in any country since 2006.\nMeanwhile, \u201cZitti E Buoni\u201d debuts on two U.S.-based charts, marking M\u00e5neskin\u2019s first ink on surveys based exclusively on U.S. data. It starts at No. 7 on World Digital Song Sales and No. 23 on the airplay-, sales- and streaming-based Hot Hard Rock Songs chart.\nThe 2021 Eurovision runner-up, France\u2019s \u201cVoila\u201d by Barbara Pravi, enters at Nos. 70 and 148 on the Global Excl. U.S. chart and Global 200, respectively. Gjon\u2019s Tears, representing Switzerland, adds another French-language title to this week\u2019s charts, as \u201cTout L\u2019Univers\u201d debuts at No. 119 on the former tally.\nItaly\u2019s Sanremo-fueled debuts in March were the first Italian-language songs to appear on either global chart (since the lists launched in September). And this week, the full Eurovision spread spurs some firsts. Go_A\u2019s \u201cShum,\u201d new at Nos. 80 and 158 on the Global Excl. U.S. chart and Global 200, respectively, is the first song by an artist from Ukraine, and the first Ukrainian-language song, to hit the global charts.\nAdditionally, three English-language Eurovision contenders debut on the Global Excl. U.S. chart, each being the first to represent their respective countries on the survey. Finland\u2019s Blind Channel debuts at No. 105 with \u201cDark Side,\u201d Iceland\u2019s Dadi Freyr arrives at No. 128 with \u201c10 Years,\u201d and Elena Tsagrinou starts at No. 170 with \u201cEl Diablo.\u201d Tsagrinou represented Cyprus in Eurovision, although she is Greek. Either way you slice it, she\u2019s breaking down barriers as neither nation had previously charted.\nThe Eurovision songs on this week\u2019s charts skewed overwhelmingly non-U.S. in their sales and streams. Together, they averaged 97% of their streams and 94% of their sales from outside the States, reflecting a massive shift from this week\u2019s overall averages of 74% and 46%, respectively.", "original_url": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/eurovision-global-charts-maneskin-zitti-e-buoni-new-around-the-world/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220602004349/https://www.billboard.com/pro/eurovision-global-charts-maneskin-zitti-e-buoni-new-around-the-world/", "a_id": "Q50729731-433"}
