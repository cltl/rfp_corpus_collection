Two among the Icelandic delegation are therefore now in isolation with active infection.\nThis morning's test result throws Iceland's Eurovision hopes this year into doubt.\nIt is certain that they will not perform live for judges at this evening's dress rehearsal, and it is highly unlikely they will perform live at tomorrow's second semi-final.\nIf the Icelandic act makes it through to the Grand Final on Saturday, it is currently also considered unlikely they will be allowed to perform live.\nEvery country has pre-recorded performances of their song to play out in the event of COVID-19 infection, but it is not clear how this will affect Da\u00f0i og Gagnamagni\u00f0's chances in the competition. Before this news, Iceland was the bookmakers' fourth-favourite to win the competition.\nThe entire Icelandic delegation was immunised with the single-dose Janssen vaccine before heading out to the Netherlands. While vaccines do not provide total protection from infection, they do reduce the likeliness of severe coronavirus illness.\nYou can watch Thursday and Saturday's shows live, in English, here.\nIf you missed the first semi-final last night, it is available for catch-up here.\nClick to follow R\u00daV English on Facebook.", "original_url": "https://www.ruv.is/frett/2021/05/19/covid-infection-among-dadi-og-gagnamagnid", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210519103107/http://www.ruv.is/frett/2021/05/19/covid-infection-among-dadi-og-gagnamagnid", "a_id": "Q50729731-42"}
