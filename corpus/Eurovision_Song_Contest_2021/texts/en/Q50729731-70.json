Kazakhstan has participated at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest since 2018. The country managed to achieve their best result in the contest in 2019 with the song \u2018Armany\u0144nan Qalma\u2019, which won the jury vote.\nMeanwhile, Kosovo has participated at the Eurovision Young Dancers in 2011 where Tringa Hysa represented the nation in Oslo. However, the country did not make the final duel.\nEBU: \u201cNo plans\u201d\nWith the deadline for broadcasters to confirm participation in Eurovision 2021 fast approaching, we reached out to the EBU to find out whether Kazakhstan and Kosovo would be invited to debut in next year\u2019s contest.\nAt the present time, there are no plans to invite Kazakhstan or Kosovo to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021. EBU\nWe would like to thank the EBU for their swift response to our query.\nAssociate members must rely on invitations\nAs an associate member of the EBU, Kazakhstan\u2019s Khabar Agency must rely on annual invitations to take part in a Eurovision contest in the same way Australia\u2019s SBS has done. However, for the time being at least, Kazakhstan\u2019s invitations will remain limited to the Junior edition of the contest.\nUnfortunately the same cannot be said for Kosovo, as it currently does not meet the criteria to apply for EBU membership. However, the EBU has mentioned that \u2018constructive discussions will continue between the EBU and RTK about future possibilities for closer co-operation.\u2019\nDo you think Kazakhstan and Kosovo should participate at the Eurovision Song Contest?
