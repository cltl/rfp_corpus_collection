Their popularity proves what a huge springboard the Eurovision Song Contest is and highlights the quality of both the acts and songs taking part.\"\nWhose footsteps are M\u00e5neskin following in by entering the Official Singles Chart Top 10? Here's a look at the last three acts who managed to pull off the rare achievement.\nThe Common Linnets\nPrior to M\u00e5neskin, the last Eurovision entrants to score an Official UK Top 10 single were The Common Linnets... and they didn't even win!\nSince Anouk's prog rock entry in 2013, The Netherlands have been on a serious run of form, sending out of the box entries that have resonated with fans continent wide, which of course culminated with Duncan Laurence's win in 2019 with Arcade, which itself entered the Official Singles Chart Top 40 for the first time in 2021 thanks to TikTok.\nInspired and impressed by Anouk's approach the previous year, when renowned Dutch pop/country singer Ilse DeLange was approached to take part in 2014, any previous reservations she had had evaporated. Ilse - who has had 11 Number 1 albums in Holland - was just starting her new Americana project The Common Linnets and she alongside fellow country artist Waylon represented their country.\nWhile their song Calm After The Storm finished second behind Conchita Wurst's Rise Like A Phoenix, The Common Linnets had the last laugh on the Official Chart, entering at Number 9 and outperforming Conchita who debuted at Number 17. As a cherry on top, their self-titled album also entered the Official Albums Chart at Number 40.\nLoreen\nIn 2012, arguably Eurovision's greatest ever song Euphoria by Loreen was the winner, an entry that really knocked down perceptions that the contest was not to be taken seriously. Euphoria was a contemporary, captivating track belted out by Loreen and her powerhouse vocals which stopped Europe in its tracks.\nThe result was a Number 3 entry on the UK's Official Singles Chart for the fascinating Swedish talent, making Euphoria the highest-charting ESC song in the UK of the last two decades.\nAlexander Rybak\nNorway's Alexander Rybak is something of a modern-day trailblazer, becoming the first international Eurovision act to enter the Official Chart top flight for 22 years when his winning song Fairytale peaked at Number 10 in 2009. Not since Johnny Logan's Hold Me Now from 1987 had a single by a foreign Eurovision act reached the Top 10.
