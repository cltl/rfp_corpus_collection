{"title": "EBU Executive Board agrees to suspension of Belarus Member BTRC", "text": "EBU Executive Board agrees to suspension of Belarus Member BTRC\nAt a meeting today the EBU Executive Board agreed to suspend Belarus Member BTRC.\nThe EBU has been closely monitoring the suppression of media freedom in Belarus and have consistently called on BTRC, as a Member of the EBU, to uphold our core values of freedom of expression, independence and accountability.\nSince the disputed elections last summer, we have been campaigning for the protection of independent journalism and freedom of expression in the country. We have publicly supported journalists at BTRC who have been protesting against government interference. We have also been monitoring BTRC\u2019s coverage and have communicated our concerns to their management.\nIn recent weeks, we have been particularly alarmed by the broadcast of interviews apparently obtained under duress.\nWe have also monitored other BTRC broadcasts on this issue which have raised other serious and quite exceptional concerns.\nIn light of these exceptional developments, the Executive Board has no alternative other than to propose the suspension of BTRC\u2019s membership of the EBU.\nBTRC will have two weeks to respond, before suspension comes into effect.", "original_url": "https://www.ebu.ch/news/2021/05/ebu-executive-board-agrees-to-suspension-of-belarus-member-btrc", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210528122141/https://www.ebu.ch/news/2021/05/ebu-executive-board-agrees-to-suspension-of-belarus-member-btrc", "a_id": "Q50729731-269"}
