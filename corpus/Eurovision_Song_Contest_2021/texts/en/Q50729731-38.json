The Eurovision postcards are shown on television whilst the stage is being prepared for the next contestant to perform their Eurovision entry, and usually lasts about up to 45 seconds.\nA participant\u2019s unique part and experience of The Netherlands\nThe Eurovision 2020 postcards will involve the artists, collaborating with a group, club or association that wants to receive one of the artists and let them participate in their activity, hobby, sport or tradition. Executive Producer of the 2020 contest Sietse Bakker has commented on the postcard concept:\nWe deliberately chose to show the best of the Netherlands during postcards: the people and their hospitality, in all their diversity. From the street barbecue, the carnival club and the student corps to the football club, the break dance group and the annual carbide shooting \u2013 we do it together. During the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 we want to show that to 180 million viewers. With the theme Open Up as a common thread, we show the positive, connecting power that fits with our country.\u201d Sietse Bakker in regards to the postcard concept for Eurovision 2020\nThe concept for the 2020 contest very much differs from the 2019 contest, where we saw the Eurovision participants dance their way throughout, the historical and tourist destinations of Israel.
