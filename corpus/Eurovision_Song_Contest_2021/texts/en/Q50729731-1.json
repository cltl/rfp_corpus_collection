The Contest\u2019s values of universality and inclusivity, and our proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music, are needed now more than ever.\nAs such, the EBU and its Members are currently exploring alternative programming, but not a competition, to help unite and entertain audiences around Europe during these challenging times.\nIt is our intention with this programming, and on our online platforms in the coming months, to honour the songs and artists which have been chosen for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020.\nWith that in mind, the Reference Group, the Song Contest\u2019s governing board, has decided that, in accordance with the Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest, this year\u2019s songs will not be eligible to compete when the Contest returns in 2021.\nAt their discretion, Participating Broadcasters may decide which artist(s) to send in 2021, either this year\u2019s representative or a new one.\nWe ask for your continued patience while we work through practical implications of these ideas in the coming days and weeks.", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/story/intention-to-honour-eurovision-2020-songs-artists", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200320195055/https://eurovision.tv/story/intention-to-honour-eurovision-2020-songs-artists", "a_id": "Q50729731-1"}
