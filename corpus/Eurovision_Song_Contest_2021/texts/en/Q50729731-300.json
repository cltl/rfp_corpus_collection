This is what we know so far.\nLast year, it was announced there\u2019d be 4 potential scenarios in which the Contest could take place in 2021. As the Contest gets closer and closer, it has become apparent which one is no longer viable.\nWhat we do know:\nThe event will definitely take place on 18, 20, and 22 May. With just over 3 months to go, the organizers of the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 have agreed upon a determined, yet realistic approach in the final phase of preparations.\nOf course, the health and safety of all participants is the top priority. In response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) together with Dutch Host broadcasters NPO, NOS, and AVROTROS and the City of Rotterdam have ruled out that the 65th Contest can take place \u2018as normal\u2019 this year. This means that Scenario A will not go ahead.\n\u201cThe Eurovision Song Contest will definitely make its welcome return this May despite the pandemic but, in the prevailing circumstances, it is regrettably impossible to hold the event in the way we are used to,\u201d said Martin \u00d6sterdahl, Executive Supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful for the renewed commitment and backing from the City of Rotterdam and the ongoing support of all the participating broadcasters. We very much hope to be able to gather in Rotterdam in May and will do all we can in the coming weeks to achieve this. With an ever-changing situation we are taking our time to ensure that we can host the Eurovision Song Contest in the best and safest way possible,\u201d he added.\nImages of the OB truck during the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest EBU / Stijn Smulders\nWhat now?\nThe organizers will now focus their efforts on Scenario B. This circumstance would involve hosting a socially distanced event with artists performing in Rotterdam, while realistically keeping downscaling options on the table for the weeks to come.\n\u201cThe security, health and safety of all participants at the Eurovision Song Contest, from the crew to the artists, is our top priority. We are following international developments closely and continuing to explore and plan for 3 revised scenarios (B, C and D) first announced last autumn,\u201d \u00d6sterdahl added.\nA further decision on how the Contest will be staged will be taken in the coming weeks. Sietse Bakker, Executive Producer Event for Host Broadcasters NPO, NOS and AVROTROS said: \u201cBy staying flexible for as long as we can, we are aiming to make the best possible Eurovision Song Contest under the circumstances. Our primary goal is to get the 41 artists to Rotterdam, to all perform on the same stage, and to welcome journalists to cover the Contest.\u201d\nThe 3 possible ways to host Eurovision 2021\nThe remaining scenarios for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2021 NPO/NOS/AVROTROS\nThe 3 scenarios being planned for are:\nScenario B: Socially distanced Eurovision Song Contest\nEveryone attending the Eurovision Song Contest at Rotterdam\u2019s Ahoy Arena would need to practice social distancing.\nStrict health and safety measures (including frequent COVID testing) would be in place at the venue.
