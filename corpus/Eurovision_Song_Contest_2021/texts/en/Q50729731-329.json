The design is inspired by the theme 'Open Up' and the typical, flat Dutch landscape. It also brings the Green Room back to the arena.\nStage designer Florian Wieder won the pitch for the stage design, in which both Dutch and foreign designers took part, this fall. Wieder: \u201cThe design shows the connection between the sky, the sea and the land. The horizon links these elements and that horizon will work as a window to open up the world of Eurovision 2020. The floor plan of the stage is inspired by the canals and bridges that connect land and water in the Netherlands. With this design, we want to bring the artists as close as possible to the audience.\u201d\nEurovision 2020 stage design NPO/AVROTROS/NOS\nAfter a year of absence, the Green Room - where the artists gather after the performance - will return to the arena. This will make the audience feel even more connected to the artists from the 41 participating countries.\nAccording to Sietse Bakker, Executive Producer Event of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020, this design fits the story the creators want to tell seamlessly: \u201cThe design is innovative, modest and functionally smart. This way we can create a completely different look for each of the 41 participating acts, opening and interval acts, and during the voting results. We\u2019ll present an innovative stage design, grand in its simplicity and yet full of surprises. The designer has perfectly translated this wish into his design.\u201d Wieder has designed the stage for the Eurovision Song Contest for the past 3 years. \"While his experience is clearly reflected in this design, he knows how to surprise,\" adds Bakker.\nEurovision 2020 stage design NPO/AVROTROS/NOS\nFlorian Wieder: \u201cI was inspired by the unique characteristics of Dutch Design. Based on that, I wanted to create an unconventional, minimalist and modern concept for next year's show. I am very happy that the Dutch public broadcaster has been so openminded and has enthusiastically embraced this design. As far as I'm concerned, this is a new chapter in stage design, a wish I have had for a long time.\"\nEurovision 2020 stage design NPO/AVROTROS/NOS\nEarlier in his career, the German designer designed the stage of several editions of the MTV Awards, Emmy Awards and various other well-known international TV shows. The stage for the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest will be created in the Netherlands and will be set up in Rotterdam Ahoy in the first weeks of April 2020.\nHow do you like the first images of the Eurovision 2020 stage?
