They've since racked up five Top 10 singles in the country, plus two Number 1 albums.\nThe band are one of a handful of acts bringing a healthy dose of rock-influenced sounds back the Official Chart, including current Number 1 Good 4 U by Olivia Rodrigo, and Willow Smith's Transparent Soul, which features Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker.\nThe pop-punk-rock sound was last popular in the mainstream between 2002-2009, when acts such as Avril Lavigne, My Chemical Romance, and Arctic Monkeys were scoring Number 1s.\nArticle image: Francis Delacroix", "original_url": "https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/maneskin-make-history-with-two-top-10-entries-on-the-official-singles-chart__33461/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210625172510/https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/maneskin-make-history-with-two-top-10-entries-on-the-official-singles-chart__33461/", "a_id": "Q50729731-427"}
