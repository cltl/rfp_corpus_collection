Earlier this month, the European Broadcasting Union stated that the rules of the contest will not be changed to allow the songs selected for 2020 to compete in the 2021 competition. The Roop, therefore, will have to enter next year\u2019s national final with a brand new song that hasn\u2019t been published before the usual 1st September cut off. As promised, the band will be receiving the \u20ac20.3k prize money from LRT for winning Pabandom i\u0161 naujo this year.\nLRT statement\nGytis Oganauskas, Deputy Director General of LRT commented:\nWe are all saddened by this situation \u2013 the song \u201cOn Fire\u201d was considered one of the main contenders to win the competition. The band has received a lot of sympathy both in Lithuania and abroad, but unfortunately we will not be able to appear on the big Eurovision scene. Eurovision is first and foremost a song contest, which is gaining popularity every year in Lithuania, stimulating the creation of new songs and performances, thus attracting many who wish to try their hand \u2013 music producers and performers. We were looking for a solution to not deprive them of this opportunity, and at the same time not to deprive The Roop. Gytis Oganauskas\nGytis Oganauskas, Deputy Director General of LRT\nAs a result, we have made a somewhat non-standard decision: we will be preparing for a new national selection, and The Roop will be nominated to appear in its final. We appreciate and thank The Roop for taking a responsible approach to preparing for this year\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest. We understand that the group has already invested a lot of time and money in this, so we also decided to transfer to the group the voting funds that were to be used to prepare for the big Eurovision. Gytis Oganauskas\nHowever, the band are still considering whether to accept LRT invitation for next year: \u201cWe understand that a variant was found that would suit the LRT and the group. Will we be involved in the screening, albeit on an exclusive basis? We don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s only been a month and a half since winning the song \u2018On Fire\u2018. Everything is going very fast. Too fast. We need to think hard and make a decision much later,\u201d says lead singer Vaidotas Valiukevi\u010dius.\nLithuania at Eurovision\nLithuania first entered the contest in 1994 with \u201cLop\u0161in\u0117 mylimai\u201d by Ovidijus Vy\u0161niauskas. Last year in Tel Aviv, Jurijus Veklenko sang \u201cRun With The Lions\u201d and came 11th in Semi-final 2 with 93 points, narrowly missing out on the Grand final. This year in Rotterdam would have been the Baltic nation\u2019s 21st Eurovision appearance, if the contest hadn\u2019t been cancelled.", "original_url": "https://escxtra.com/2020/03/31/the-roop-invited-back-to-lithuanian-2021-national-selection/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200401230520/https://escxtra.com/2020/03/31/the-roop-invited-back-to-lithuanian-2021-national-selection/", "a_id": "Q50729731-28"}
