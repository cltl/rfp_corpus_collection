Now, could the United States be following in Australia\u2019s footsteps as the next nation to join the Eurovision party?\nJon Ola at the Eurosonic conference\nThis week, the Dutch city of Groningen is hosting the Eurosonic Noorderslag, a European music showcase, festival and conference. Naturally, the Eurovision Song Contest\u2019s executive supervisor Jon Ola Sand was in attendance. Dutch website dvhn.nl summarised one of the key points of discussion: United States and Eurovision.\nAmerican Song Contest must come first\nAsked whether the United States could participate in the main Eurovision Song Contest, Sand explained that it was first key to see whether the American Song Contest would be a success. If so, then the EBU would look as to whether the United States could be granted a place in the Eurovision Song Contest.\nA debut will not happen \u201cduring his time\u201d\nSand was keen to reiterate that United States participating in the Eurovision Song Contest would not happen \u201cin [his] time\u201d as head of the Eurovision Song Contest. Of course, Sand is due to step down following this year\u2019s contest in Rotterdam.\nJon Ola Sand\u2019s refusal to rule out such a debut will fascinate many Eurovision fans, may the 2020s see a Eurovision debut from the United States?
