{"title": "EBU Statement on alleged drug use at Eurovision Song Contest 2021", "text": "EBU Statement on alleged drug use at Eurovision Song Contest 2021\nFollowing allegations of drug use in the Green Room of the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Final on Saturday 22 May, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), as requested by the Italian delegation, has conducted a thorough review of the facts, including checking all available footage. A drug test was also voluntarily undertaken earlier today by the lead singer of the band M\u00e5neskin which has returned a negative result seen by the EBU.\nNo drug use took place in the Green Room and we consider the matter closed.\nWe are alarmed that inaccurate speculation leading to fake news has overshadowed the spirit and the outcome of the event and unfairly affected the band.\nWe wish to congratulate M\u00e5neskin once again and wish them huge success. We look forward to working with our Italian member Rai on producing a spectacular Eurovision Song Contest in Italy next year.", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/ebu-statement-on-alleged-drug-use-at-eurovision-song-contest-2021", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210524161858/https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/ebu-statement-on-alleged-drug-use-at-eurovision-song-contest-2021", "a_id": "Q50729731-227"}
