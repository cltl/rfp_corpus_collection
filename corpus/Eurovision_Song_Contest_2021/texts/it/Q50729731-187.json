Their debut year saw their best result to date, as Edyta Gorniak finished in 2nd place with her song \u201cTo nie ja!\u201d. Following this, Poland failed to repeat this initial success, managing a top 10 placing on only one other occasion during their initial 1994-2011 run in the contest. In 2012, following a string of non-qualifications, Poland withdrew from the contest due to financial difficulties. Since their return in 2014, they have been considerably more successful in the contest, having qualified for the final for every year up to 2017.", "original_url": "https://eurovoix.com/2021/05/14/poland-rafal-revamp/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210514144624/https://eurovoix.com/2021/05/14/poland-rafal-revamp/", "a_id": "Q50729731-187"}
