She wore black and Vasil wore a madras shirt and sil\u00adver sneak\u00aders. Rox\u00adolana said, \u201cOkay, what are we go\u00ading to do?\u201d\nVasil is a young Mace\u00addo\u00adnian opera stu\u00addent. He is here to study voice at the Royal Con\u00adser\u00adva\u00adtory of Mu\u00adsic. He needed to warm up.\nAnd so Rox\u00adolana, one of his in\u00adstruc\u00adtors, slapped a big fat chord on the key\u00adboard, and Vasil warmed up with scales. His voice in that small and sud\u00adden prac\u00adtice room was salt in the ocean and light in the air; it was ev\u00adery\u00adwhere all at once. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d said Rox\u00adolana.\nAnd then she of\u00adfered, firmly, \u201cYou need to gen\u00ader\u00adate more mo\u00adtion be\u00adtween the notes.\u201d He sang more and she said, \u201cPer\u00adfect.\u201d Oh, it was.\nAnd then she said, \u201cLet\u2019s do the Mozart.\u201d He would be singing the Mozart later that evening, at a con\u00adcert given by stu\u00addents in hon\u00adour of the con\u00adser\u00adva\u00adtory\u2019s donors.\nRox\u00adolana said, \u201cStart ag\u00adgres\u00adsive, and pull back emo\u00adtion\u00adally.\u201d He did. She said, \u201cGo for the beat; clear notes inside ev\u00adery clus\u00adter; let the en\u00adergy of the beat pro\u00adpel the notes.\u201d\nVasil is a good stu\u00addent. He is a lyric bari\u00adtone. He said, \u201cA lot of peo\u00adple are say\u00ading this is not a dra\u00admatic piece.\u201d Rox\u00adolana said, \u201cA lot of peo\u00adple are wrong.\u201d This is what is dra\u00admatic: Vasil is 21 years old. He is here on a schol\u00adar\u00adship. He said, \u201cI grew up in a town called Stru\u00admica. There is a street in town with a lot of bou\u00adtiques. When I was very young, my mother used to bring me with her when she shopped. I was al\u00adways singing on the street.\n\u201cAcross from one of the shops lived a Mace\u00addo\u00adnian com\u00adposer. One day he heard me through his open win\u00addow. He called to my mother and in\u00advited us up\u00adstairs. He wanted me to sing for him. He would play some\u00adthing, and I would sing it back to him.\n\u201cHe had been try\u00ading to teach a singer. She was hav\u00ading trou\u00adble with a par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar song. The com\u00adposer played the song for me. I sang it back to him and he recorded me, and he gave the tape to her.\u201d\nVasil, al\u00admost overnight, be\u00adcame a pop star in Mace\u00addo\u00adnia. He be\u00adgan to make reg\u00adu\u00adlar ap\u00adpear\u00adances on television, his record\u00adings sold hand over fist, and his live con\u00adcerts were huge and fren\u00adzied; in your dreams, Ren\u00e9 Si\u00admard.\nAnd then war broke out in Kosovo. \u201cMy mother said we were go\u00ading to Chicago. There would be no more singing. We were go\u00ading to start over. I couldn\u2019t speak English. All I could say was yes, no and fuck you, from the movies.\n\u201cI was en\u00adter\u00ading high school in Chicago. My first me\u00admory was of gym class. I had long hair. The gym teacher said some\u00adthing to me. I had no idea what he had said. I replied yes. The whole class laughed. A friend told me later that he had asked if I was a girl. That made me an\u00adgry. I didn\u2019t speak for two years. I am very stub\u00adborn.\n\u201cBut in the school there was a choir. One day I brought the mu\u00adsic teacher a tape of one of my con\u00adcerts from Mace\u00addo\u00adnia. She could see me on stage, with thou\u00adsands cheer\u00ading. She found me in the lunch\u00adroom. I thought I was in trou\u00adble. She said, \u2018Fab\u00adu\u00adlous.\u2019 \u201d\nShe made him a soloist. Vasil even\u00adtu\u00adally au\u00addi\u00adtioned and was ac\u00adcepted in the Chicago Chil\u00addren\u2019s Choir, and he sang at the White House and in Carnegie Hall. He won com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion af\u00adter com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion. He got schol\u00adar\u00adship af\u00adter schol\u00adar\u00adship. He sang backup for Ce\u00adline. And then came 9/11. Life got murky in Amer\u00adica. Vasil, who had a schol\u00adar\u00adship from the Na\u00adtional Foun\u00adda\u00adtion for Ad\u00advance\u00adment in the Arts, was ac\u00adcused of ly\u00ading about his cit\u00adi\u00adzen\u00adship. The foun\u00adda\u00adtion took back his schol\u00adar\u00adship. Vasil was to be de\u00adported with his fam\u00adily.\nHe said, \u201cThe Chicago Chil\u00addren\u2019s Choir had an evening for donors. The chil\u00addren were to read a speech. I wrote a fairy tale about my story, and then I read the let\u00adter of de\u00adpor\u00adta\u00adtion. Six\u00adhun\u00addred peo\u00adple were cry\u00ading. A wo\u00adman in the au\u00addi\u00adence said, \u2018What\u00adever you want to do, I will pay.\u2019 A lawyer said, \u2018I will help you for free.\u2019 \u201cMy dad, mom and brother went back to Mace\u00addo\u00adnia, and I was al\u00adlowed to stay in the States. I grad\u00adu\u00adated alone.\u201d He went back to Mace\u00addo\u00adnia when his fa\u00adther was put in jail. When Vasil ap\u00adplied to re\u00adturn to Amer\u00adica, the U.S. em\u00adbassy said he couldn\u2019t go back.\n\u201cI had been ac\u00adcepted by the Man\u00adhat\u00adtan School of Mu\u00adsic. They said they could not hold my place. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I still wanted to study. I ap\u00adplied to the Lon\u00addon school of mu\u00adsic. They ac\u00adcepted me but wanted me to wait a year. In Mace\u00addo\u00adnia, I was be\u00ading pres\u00adsured to sing pop. But I wanted opera.\u201d\nIf you saw him on the street, you\u2019d never get a hint of this. But if you heard him sing, you might. How Vasil came to study opera in Toronto is a story for an up\u00adcom\u00ading col\u00adumn; stay tuned. Joe Fiorito usu\u00adally ap\u00adpears Mon\u00adday, Wed\u00adnes\u00adday and Fri\u00adday.
