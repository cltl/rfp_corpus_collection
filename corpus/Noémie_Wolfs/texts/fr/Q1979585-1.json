{"title": "On top of the world", "text": "On top of the world\nAfter little more than a year with the Belgian rock-pop band Hooverphonic, lead singer No\u00e9mie Wolfs is gaining popularity and a widespread following. Behind-the-scenes photos by Blandine Lejeune\nTall and slender, with a self-confidence that belies her 23 years, vocalist No\u00e9mie Wolfs arrives for the Together cover photo shoot flushed with the success of winning Best Band category at the annual Music Industry Awards. It\u2019s an overcast, windy winter day in Brussels and freezing cold, so the warmth of the palatial Hotel Metropole is a welcome relief.\nWith carte blanche from the hotel management, photographer Charlie De Keersmaecker and the stylist go hunting for a location to take photographs, and Wolfs bends over a bathtub to wash her hair while the hairdresser and make-up artist unpack the tools of their respective trades.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the award,\u201d says Wolfs. \u201cWe won it for everyone who works with us, and it\u2019s a great compliment to get an award so soon in our first year together.\u201d\nPLATINUM\n\u201cOf more than 1,000 applicants from all over the world, only Wolfs met expectations\u201d\nLong having enjoyed international success, Hooverphonic has survived several reincarnations since forming in 1995, the most recent being the addition of Wolfs after band members Alex Callier and Raymond Geerts set out with the risky objective of replacing the former lead singer who left to start a solo career. Of more than 1,000 applicants from all over the world, only Wolfs \u2013 with exceptional talent, but no musical background or experience \u2013 met expectations. Hooverphonic released the single The Night Before at the end of October 2010 to introduce Wolfs to the world, and the album of the same name came out a month later. It went platinum in Belgium shortly after its release.\n\u201cI really liked Hooverphonic\u2019s music, but I didn\u2019t expect to get anywhere,\u201d says Wolfs of the selection process.\nPLANNING\nBorn in the Flemish village of Scherpenheuvel-Zichem, Wolfs says she has a \u201cgreat bond\u201d with her family, her only complaint being she no longer has the time to see them as often as she would like. Another big difference is organisation and planning and being told where she should be and when she should be there. \u201cIt controls your life completely, which is okay because I really am a chaotic person, so I need people who are organised.\u201d If she has a complaint, it\u2019s about \u201ca lot of waiting around\u201d between arriving at a venue, sound checks and performing, which she puts down to \u201cbeing a really impatient person\u201d. Another disappointment has been the travel, which has so far included gigs in Russia. \u201cYou know you are going to play somewhere exciting like Moscow, but you also know you are not going to see anything while you\u2019re there, which is really frustrating.\u201d\nShe misses old friends, and has found it difficult to keep up with them \u2013 \u201cIt is sometimes hard for them to understand that I am working all the time \u2013 my weekends are Monday and Tuesday\u201d \u2013 but appreciates the new friendships she has formed, although there is currently no \u2018significant other\u2019 in her life. \u201cI have 13 men in my band \u2013 I don\u2019t have time for anyone else right now.\u201d\nTEAMWORK\nThe photographer wants Wolfs on the balcony of the hotel room so he can shoot against the skyline; stylist Amke Rijkenbarg unpacks clothes borrowed from the collection of designer C\u00e9line De Schepper, while Wolfs has her make-up applied by Hassan Benabid of Giorgio Armani Cosmetics. This is a team that is used to working with each other, hairdresser Juliette Girard discussing the merits of eating breakfast as she manoeuvres hairdryer and curling tongs. \u201cFrosties for me,\u201d reveals Wolfs.\n\u201cI always like to work with No\u00e9mie,\u201d enthuses Armani\u2019s Benabid. \u201cShe has a very porcelain skin, and her looks fit beautifully with our brand.\u201d\nComments Wolfs: \u201cA year ago, I was not at all into make-up and hair; now my friends ask me for advice.\u201d And then: \u201cI feel like Lady Gaga,\u201d she quips, as outsize wooden bracelets are threaded onto her arms, before braving the cold and standing on the parapet of the balcony overlooking the entrance of the hotel \u2013 not for the vertiginous.\n\u201cI love playing dress up. If I had to do this every day \u2013 that would be boring,\u201d says Wolfs of the shoot. \u201cIt is fun to do, like, 20 times a year but not every day \u2013 I would make a terrible model. The most interesting aspect of this job is that you can do different things every day.\u201d\nAfter several hours of preparation, the actual photo shoot is over in a matter of minutes, yet in that short time Wolfs has attracted the attention of passers-by on the ground below. \u201cThey were shouting things like \u2018You should wear a helmet\u2019,\u201d she giggles.\nSOLD OUT\n\u201cSinging is something I need to do; it is my whole life\u201d\nTickets for a planned series of concerts at home in Antwerp in March and April are proving so popular \u2013 two nights have sold out \u2013 that extra concerts have been added. Fans will be treated to the best of 15 years of Hooverphonic backed by a 42 piece orchestra. \u201cWe\u2019ve got strings and trumpets \u2013 the whole shebang,\u201d says Wolfs. One of the prerequisites to her joining Hooverphonic was her ability to reinterpret the back catalogue.\nAware that she hasn\u2019t had to struggle in the music industry to make it big, she says: \u201cIt is bizarre that I have realised my dream early on,\u201d revealing it was actually also her father\u2019s childhood dream to become a famous rock star. Wolfs is also mature enough to recognise that her life is privileged in relation to other musicians and bands. \u201cI used to think musicians didn\u2019t work as hard as everyone else, but that is not true. It is more fun, but we work just as hard.\u201d She pauses, and adds in a rush: \u201cSinging is something I need to do; it is my whole life, it means everything to me, it is like breathing. If I lost my voice it would be a disaster \u2013 I would rather go blind than deaf.\u201d\nHooverphonic is in concert at Antwerp\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Hall March 6, 7, 8 and April 27, 28, 29 \u2013 visit the website for details: www.hooverphonic.com", "original_url": "https://togethermag.eu/on-top-of-the-world/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201229180047/https://togethermag.eu/on-top-of-the-world/", "a_id": "Q1979585-1"}
