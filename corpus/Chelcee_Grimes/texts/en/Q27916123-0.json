Everyone went \u2018that\u2019s it, that\u2019s it\u2019!\u201d\nThe resulting track, completed just an hour later, was Million Miles, listed number two on Kylie\u2019s latest album Kiss Me Once. Inspired by Chelcee missing home in Liverpool, it will be the Aussie icon\u2019s next European single release.\n\u201cIt made sense because it was the first time I\u2019d been away from my family and I just sang \u2018I feel like I\u2019m a million, million, milion, feel like I\u2019m a million miles away ...\u2019 And that was the hook. I could have chosen any subject, they just played me the track they\u2019d built for her sound and asked for lyrics and a top line, but that was what came to me.\n\u201cWe sent it straight to Kylie that night and she replied to say \u2018love it\u2019, and the next week she was in London recording it,\u201d smiles Chelcee. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew, OK, I can do this.\u201d\nFor Chelcee, seeing her name on the album with the likes of Pharrell and Sia not only reinforced her own confidence, but showcased her to an industry desperate for gifted lyricists. In a music world full of aspiring performers, genuine hit makers are scarce.\nBut having two parallel options has meant making a big decision for the former St Julie\u2019s girl: to split her focus between writing for other big name artists and still pursuing her own performing ambitions.\nPicture by Jason Roberts...... Story Mark Johnson.....Chelcee Grimes play at the Anthony Walker Foundatiion day at the Liverpool Guild of Students.\nSinging has been central to her life since she was 16, when music overtook football as her main passion.\nBrought up in Aigburth, Chelcee had her sights set on becoming a professional footballer from the age of 11 when she signed for Liverpool. At 15, she crossed the park to Everton, taking PE and sciences at GCSEs with a secondary plan to move into sports physiotherapy.\n\u201cI had to choose one more GCSE, and it was between history, geography or music,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was rubbish at history and geography so I thought I\u2019d do music, even though I didn\u2019t sing at all at the time. But I really got into it and I found a little studio that would let me stay behind after school and put some songs down I\u2019d written.\u201d\nSoon music was challenging football for her affections. \u201cI\u2019d score a goal and run back to the half way line singing,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut then if I went to the studio and missed training they\u2019d bench me for the next game, so I had to make a decision between the two.\u201d\nMusic won, and with manager Martin O\u2019Shea guiding her, Chelcee set about launching her own singing career. Competition was fierce, though, and she had to be patient waiting for a breakthrough.\n\u201cIt was hard,\u201d she admits, \u201cand I\u2019d say to Martin, \u2018I need something to happen soon\u2019, but I never asked \u2018will it happen?\u2019 because I always knew it would.\u201d\nWhat remained unfailing was the apparent ease with which she can create a pop song.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I work, quick,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get a melody or a lyric in the first minute or two I\u2019ll move on. Now I\u2019ll be at workshops and everyone else will be writing five songs and I\u2019ll have 14!\u201d\nThe internet, she says, has played a big part in getting her name known.\nThe Saturdays and Little Mix are just two of the bands who have tapped into her talents, she\u2019s worked with South Korea\u2019s biggest pop star Boi and she\u2019s also written with the team which pens hits for Rihanna. X Factor\u2019s Tamera Foster and Luke Friend are on her CV, and she\u2019s got one eye on the current series for who will be next.\nSome days she will write specifically with particular artists in mind and other times it will be for herself. \u201cAnd then if someone else wants it, great,\u201d she shrugs.\n\u201cAbout a month ago I wrote a song for me in about 15 minutes, called Generation. I don\u2019t know how it got there, but two days later we got a call from the head of Capitol records in America saying \u2018we\u2019ve heard this song, we love it, we want it for Tori Kelly.\u2019 It was crazy, I just said \u2018yes, go for it.\u2019 So it went from an idea in my head to the head of the biggest label in the States ringing me!\u201d\nVIEW GALLERY\nDemand means Chelcee splits her time between Liverpool, London, Europe and the US these days. Most recently she\u2019s been in LA, meeting with legendary producer and American Idol judge Randy Jackson and the teams behind Britney and J-Lo. They heard Chelcee the songwriter, and now they\u2019re keen on Chelcee the artist.\nSo which will it be?\n\u201cI\u2019m pinching myself, the stuff that\u2019s happening to me at the moment, so I\u2019m thankful for it all,\u201d she says. \u201cBut which would I prefer, a number one for someone else or for me? Definitely me ...\u201d", "original_url": "http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/real-lives/liverpool-chelcee-grimes-kylie-minogue-7744354", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150124152952/http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/real-lives/liverpool-chelcee-grimes-kylie-minogue-7744354", "a_id": "Q27916123-0"}
