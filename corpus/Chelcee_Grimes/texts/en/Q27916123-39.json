{"title": "Finest Selection: The Greatest Hits", "text": "Finest Selection: The Greatest Hits\nAlbum Review\nBritish pop sensations and cross-Atlantic reality television stars the Saturdays have built a worldwide brand out of their ebullient, often dance-oriented R&B. In keeping with their global branding domination, the five-member, all-female group followed up their hit 2013 studio album, Living for the Weekend, and accompanying E! Network reality TV show Chasing the Saturdays, by releasing their first-ever best-of collection with 2014's Finest Selection: The Greatest Hits. Compiling tracks off each of the group's albums including 2008's Chasing Lights, 2009's Wordshaker, 2010's Headlines!, 2011's On Your Radar, and 2013's Living for the Weekend, Finest Selection features most all of the group's best-known songs. Technically speaking, included here are all 18 of the Saturdays' singles, including their U.K. number hit \"What About Us.\" Other popular cuts included here are such songs as \"Higher\" (featuring Flo-Rida), \"All Fired Up,\" \"Disco Love,\" \"Notorious,\" \"Gentleman,\" and many more. Finest Selection also features three newly recorded songs with the Xenomania-produced \"What Are You Waiting For?,\" \"808,\" and \"Walking Through the Desert.\" Some versions of the collection also include a DVD featuring all of the group's music videos. For fans looking for a nice single-disc overview of the group's sound, this compilation fits the bill quite well. Ultimately, as with all of the Saturdays' studio albums, Finest Selection is an infectious, danceclub-ready summation of the group\u2019s chart-dominating pop career thus far.", "original_url": "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/finest-selection-greatest/id897302443", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160306183955/https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/finest-selection-greatest/id897302443", "a_id": "Q27916123-39"}
