Just go for it.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165\nIt\u2019s fair to say life is busy for Chelcee Grimes right now.\nThe 26-year-old, who hails from the Aigburth region of Liverpool, is somehow having to find the time to combine her successful singer-songwriter career with her other vocation - playing professionally for Fulham FC Women.\nOh, and she\u2019s recently been commissioned to host her own bite-sized show via BBC Sport.\nBut no matter what her schedule, there\u2019s something she\u2019ll always make time for: her passion for Liverpool Football Club.\n\u201cIt runs throughout my family, we\u2019re all big Reds,\u201d Chelcee tells Liverpoolfc.com, utilising a gap between a day of meetings, studio time and an evening of training with Fulham to chat.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any brothers or sisters, so growing up my uncle would take me to the games because I was into my football.\n\u201cI really fell in love with everything about the club. And I suppose because I\u2019m from Liverpool - and my family are all big Reds - it was kind of in the blood from an early age anyway.\n\u201cI always try and get up to watch a game as often as I can, but it can be difficult with living in London now. I was at the Newcastle game recently, the 4-0, and loved it. And I was at the Watford game earlier this week.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just on the terraces that Chelcee\u2019s Liverpool love affair blossomed.\nA trial at an Ian Rush soccer school in the city lead to the opportunity to don the red jersey for the club she adores, further cementing its place in her heart.\n\u201cI began playing for Liverpool U10s, so I was in the women\u2019s team from the age of nine up to 16. I did go to Everton for a season, but we won\u2019t talk about that!\u201d\nIt was at Anfield, though, where magical nights captured the imagination of the starry-eyed young Scouser.\n\u201cI always say, one of the first \u2013 and best \u2013 memories I have was being at the Olympiacos game in the year we won the Champions League,\u201d she explains. \u201cI was about 13 then and it was the best time of my life. I remember from then on, there was no way I could not love us.\n\u201cWhen Stevie scored, oh my god, it was magic. We went 1-0 down and had to score three goals, but I could tell \u2013 I knew we were going to do it. Then he stepped up and hit that volley\u2026 absolute scenes! It was classic Liverpool; making it hard for ourselves but getting there in the end.\u201d\nThose sentiments certainly rung true five months later, when Liverpool defied the odds \u2013 yet again \u2013 to clinch their fifth European Cup, coming back from three goals down at half-time to defeat AC Milan on penalties in Istanbul.\n\u201cI was on Lark Lane with my nan and grandad, my mum and a few family friends. My uncle was there in Istanbul and I remember him texting us at half-time\u2026 I was crying in the pub and all the Evertonians in there were giving us stick. Fast forward a bit, extra-time, penalties, and I was crying with happiness in the end. I remember it all clearly.\n\u201cI went to the parade the next day. I think everyone in the city who is a Red and wasn\u2019t at the game was there, weren\u2019t they? It was absolutely mental.\n\u201cI actually played at the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup draw in Paris recently. I didn\u2019t know who was going to be there, FIFA just gave me a call because they\u2019d seen I was in music and played football. When I was just about to go on stage, I saw a bit of a kerfuffle and wondered who it was and then Kaka walked in, so I got to perform for him.\n\u201cHe ran rings around us for the first half in Istanbul, so I told him, \u2018I remember crying at half-time because you were killing us!\u2019 He laughed and said he loved the club and he never played at Anfield, but he was excited to play in the legends game at Anfield.\u201d\nChelcee and her teammates in her days of representing LFC\nIt was 2009 when Chelcee was given her first break in the music industry \u2013 and again, Liverpool FC was a prevalent part of her opportunity.\nIt\u2019s one of those strange quirks of fate she now represents the same club as the man partly responsible for it, former Reds forward Ryan Babel, who joined Fulham during the transfer window last month. He had run a competition on local radio station, Juice FM, with the prize a six-month recording contract.\n\u201cI sent him a note when I heard he had signed for Fulham and said let\u2019s catch-up when you\u2019re settled in. He said he\u2019d love to. I am wishing him all the best and hopefully they can get a few results to stay up. He\u2019s a great guy.\u201d\nA record deal with a major label was to follow, but Grimes\u2019 career didn\u2019t take off in the way she\u2019d hoped.\nNevertheless, the mentality exhibited by the aforementioned Liverpool class of 2004-05 \u2013 never knowing when you\u2019re beaten, always adopting a never-say-die spirit \u2013 is something that had become imprinted on her.\nJust like her idols on the pitch, Chelcee has had to overcome setbacks before reaching the highs and soon after being released from her label, she turned her hand to songwriting, ultimately penning Kylie Minogue\u2019s Million Miles track.\n\u201cYou can apply that inspiration [of the 2005 Champions League final] to what I do now,\u201d she reflects. \u201cI haven\u2019t come from anything, none of my family are musicians, they are all working-class people. I grew up in Aigburth and I started with a dream in my room, hoping that white wall would one day be people at my shows, saying that I\u2019d inspired them.\n\u201cI think, even now, I don\u2019t look and appreciate all the stuff I have done because I am always onto the next one, onto the next one. I think that\u2019s what football has installed into me; you\u2019re only as good as your last result \u2013 and in the music business, you\u2019re only as good as your last song.\n\u201cLike football, music is similar in the sense you get signed by a manager, but before you get to release your single he leaves and another manager comes in. If he doesn\u2019t really like your style of play \u2013 in this case your music \u2013 you\u2019re let go. So, I was let go early on in my career, but had money in the bank, so I went travelling and learned a lot about myself.\n\u201cI knew I was a good song writer, so I decided to have a crack at it to get some clout and respect in the industry because I tried again with my own solo record. The first session I went to write for someone else was Kylie Minogue.\n\"I have learned so much about who I want to be as an artist by writing a dance song on Monday, writing a country song on Tuesday, meeting all different kinds of people from different worlds and countries. It\u2019s been amazing and I am so happy it happened to me because I am a much better person and artist because of it. And the label that dropped me ended up re-signing me!\u201d\nFast forward to 2017, and Chelcee could proudly boast three writing credits on Dua Lipa\u2019s self-titled and critically acclaimed debut album.\nIt was, then, with a sense of overwhelming pride she watched the songstress \u2013 who she considers a personal friend \u2013 provide the entertainment before the Champions League final with Liverpool and Real Madrid in Kiev last May.\nA performance that went viral having been aided by Reds fans\u2019 rendition of One Kiss in the stands of the Olympiyskiy NSC.\n\u201cShe was made up. We were watching some of the videos of it in the studio the other day. She was like, \u2018How has that happened?\u2019 She\u2019s really happy about it, she loves it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve told her she has a lot of Liverpool fans now. She was aware of them singing One Kiss in the stands and thought it was really funny; she\u2019s not the biggest football fan but she loves Liverpool \u2013 and her manager is a big Liverpool fan.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she expected it, but sometimes it\u2019s meant to be! All of us around her, we\u2019re all big Liverpool fans, so it was really funny to see for us when it happened.\n\u201cAnd Liverpool people know good music!\u201d\nDua Lipa performs ahead of the Champions League final in Kiev\nWhen Chelcee isn\u2019t writing new music or producing her own tracks, she can be found operating as a striker for Fulham FC Women.\nThere\u2019s one obvious question, though: how on earth does she manage to find the time to cram everything in to a 24-hour day?\n\u201cJust then before we started this interview, I got a call to ask if I could go to the studio that night to work with Ella Henderson, but I told them I couldn\u2019t because I had training,\u201d she reveals.\n\u201cI had been out for eight weeks because I\u2019d overstretched my ACL \u2013 it\u2019s the first injury I have ever had in football. I can feel my body getting a little bit more tired because I am in the studio, taking my kit bag, straight from there on the train going to training. It\u2019s hard when I am out of the country because I can\u2019t be there, so I have missed more games this season than I would have liked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act. The women\u2019s game doesn\u2019t pay as much as I make from music, so sometimes I have to choose that because I have to live and make money. For example, tonight I had to choose the football because I\u2019ve missed it so much. There\u2019s constantly a decision to make; hopefully I can make that Ella Henderson session work another time!\n\u201cRight now, I feel I am part of the new generation of women - I don\u2019t just do one thing. People were always like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to do this or that\u2019, or \u2018You\u2019ve got to be a TV presenter, or just got to be a song writer\u2026\u2019 But I am like, \u2018No, I am a singer/songwriter/footballer\u2026 and I can do a lot of other things, too!\u2019 I don\u2019t think we have to box ourselves in anymore. If you\u2019ve got it, just go for it.\n\u201cI am happy right now \u2013 I have never been happier, actually. I have got more things going on just because I am doing things that feel good, and I am not really fussed about what people think anymore. I am just doing what feels good to me.\u201d\nChelcee on the attack for Fulham FC Women\nPart of her strongmindedness, Chelcee feels, was derived from her idolisation of Steven Gerrard.\n\u201cI grew up when Carragher and Gerrard and the likes of those guys were in the team, Michael Owen. That\u2019s the era I grew up in, but for me it\u2019s Stevie as my biggest inspiration.\n\u201cI always say, he is just a hero to me and a big inspiration to people, coming from the city and doing things that you can only dream of. He actually liked something on my Instagram a few weeks ago, so he knows who I am! That\u2019s a start and hopefully I can play a few tunes for him one day.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Grimes was earlier this year commissioned to host a short BBC Sport series Chelcee Away, in which she accompanies friends from the music world to FA Cup matches.\n\u201cI am the only person right now in music who also plays professional football. There was a missing link somewhere and I thought I should be taking all my music mates to the football because when we\u2019re in the studio all we talk about is football, and when I am at football all they want to talk to me about is my music.\u201d\nRegardless of her schedule, Chelcee ensures she follows the fortunes of the current crop of Reds.\n\u201cWhen we don\u2019t win, I can wake up the next day feeling like I\u2019ve got a bad hangover because of it,\u201d she laughs.\nStill, there haven\u2019t been many of those occasions so far in 2018-19.\n\u201cIf someone put us in this position at the beginning of the season, we would have taken it. We are up there and we are battling for it. I still believe, I believe we can do it. City are a great team, you can\u2019t take that away from them, but it\u2019s going to be close and will go down to the wire. But I believe, 100 per cent. We can do it.\u201d\nPart of the reason Chelcee has steadfast belief in Liverpool\u2019s prospects of success is down to the manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp.\n\u201cI just love him, he is brilliant - what a character he is! In fact, if he wasn\u2019t at Liverpool, we\u2019d all want him. He is just a great guy and the character he has suits us down to the ground. He embodies everything about Liverpool Football Club and what we\u2019re all about.\n\u201cHe appreciates the fans and the club so much, you can tell he really cares. That\u2019s enough for me, but obviously if we can win anything this season, it\u2019ll be the cherry on the top of the cake.\n\u201cIn terms of the players, Salah\u2026 what a guy he is. Talking about character, he is a lovely guy, seems super humble, and I love watching him play. Van Dijk is different class and I think Naby has the potential to become a big player.\n\u201cThere really looks like there is a togetherness among the squad and when we play at our best, no-one can stop us.\u201d\nFor both Chelcee personally and Liverpool collectively, the coming months look to hold plenty in store.\nShe\u2019ll be releasing new music in the spring, while the Reds continue to battle on two fronts to bring silverware back to Anfield.\n\u201cWhat are my aims? For Liverpool, if we can come away at the end of the season and we\u2019re lifting that trophy \u2013 because I have never seen us win the league \u2013 that\u2019s my hope and what I am dreaming about at night.\n\u201cFor me, making more music for other people and myself. I have an EP coming out in April which I am so excited about because it\u2019s the best music I\u2019ve ever written. I\u2019ve got some great songs coming out with other artists, that I am super proud of.\n\u201cJust more of that, really \u2013 hard work, more music, more travelling and hopefully getting back to Liverpool soon to see the Reds lift that trophy in May!\u201d\nWatch Chelcee feature in her latest track - Jonas Blues' Wild - on YouTube now>>", "original_url": "https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/features/339569-chelcee-grimes-long-read-interview", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190301153037/https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/features/339569-chelcee-grimes-long-read-interview", "a_id": "Q27916123-1"}
