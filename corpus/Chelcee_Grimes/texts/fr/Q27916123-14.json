{"title": "Dua Lipa on Future Nostalgia and rejecting stan culture", "text": "Dua Lipa on Future Nostalgia and rejecting stan culture\nDua Lipa figured out how she was going to save pop music while walking, alone, around Las Vegas. At the corner of faux-New York and faux-Paris, inspired by Outkast and Gwen Stefani, she conceived the name for her second album: Future Nostalgia.\n\u201cI messaged my A&R, \u2018I think I have my album title,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Once you tell me this, and if your heart is set on it, we can\u2019t tell anyone. It\u2019s like a baby name.\u201d As soon as she said \u201cFuture Nostalgia\u201d \u2013 a reference to pushing her sound forward, while also a tribute to the 2000s electropop and R&B she grew up on \u2013 it was a lock. It focused the songs, it focused Lipa and it gave the album a purpose. \u201cI want it to be the album that young girls look back on the way I look back on Missundaztood by Pink or The Dutchess by Fergie,\u201d she says. \u201cI want it to be a soundtrack for young girls when they get older. I want it to age well.\u201d\nThe focus has clearly worked. It\u2019s been a hot while since an album\u2019s launch has come out so consistently strong from the offing. When the first song, \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now\u201d, dropped in November 2019, it at once became the perfect soundtrack to every TV advert, SoulCycle class and wedding dance floor. Then, the title track: a weird, sexy banger that feels more like The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cAutomatic\u201d than anything in the Top 40. Then, a few weeks before we met, she released \u201cPhysical\u201d, a storming bop that did absolutely everything the old Lipa didn\u2019t: it was about love rather than heartbreak, with a video full of intense choreography and bringing the kind of Moroder-esque darkness that made it feel like a forgotten gem from Flashdance.\nHer fourth, \u201cBreak My Heart\u201d \u2013 \u201cmy special one\u201d, she calls it \u2013 features an INXS sample. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018dance-crying\u2019 to a tee,\u201d she says with a laugh, using her term for what others might call a sad banger. \u201cIt came from a really good place: that thing of being so happy.\u201d After becoming known as the woman who sticks a finger up at all your awful exes, Lipa has gone full optimist. \u201cI\u2019ve been describing the album as a dancercise class. It keeps you moving.\u201d There\u2019s barely a ballad in sight. \u201cSome mid-tempo bits that give me a bit of a breather when I\u2019m on tour... but I\u2019ve been a little bit relentless with this one.\u201d\nIt was her sixth single, 2017\u2019s \u201cNew Rules\u201d, that changed the game for her. After entering the UK singles chart at No75, it climbed to No1 over the next five weeks, thanks to the video\u2019s viral success, becoming the first UK chart topper for a female solo artist since Adele\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d in 2015.\n\u201cI also didn\u2019t think my album was going to do what it did,\u201d admits Lipa. The song\u2019s cowriter, Emily Warren, credits its success, in part, to being a break-up song for women by women. \u201cWomen are singing what men think they want to say,\u201d says Warren, \u201crather than what they want to.\u201d The success of \u201cNew Rules\u201d \u2013 a song of Lysistrata-level female solidarity, released in the middle of the Me Too movement \u2013 has changed all that. \u201cPeople care about what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Warren continued, \u201cbecause they need what you\u2019re saying, because that\u2019s the music people want to hear.\u201d\n\u2018I was born to do this. I\u2019m exactly where I\u2019m meant to be\u2019\nThat\u2019s what Lipa\u2019s first album became known for: songs about the catharsis of getting over bad former lovers, the fundamental fabric of disco music, even if she was drawing more from R&B than Donna Summer. But the sound of Future Nostalgia \u2013 which mixes Janet Jackson, Moloko and more \u2013 \u201cis a better representation of me than my first record\u201d, says Lipa, as I hitch a ride with her through London between appointments in March, an indication of just how busy she is currently.\n\u201cI thought my first record was so me...\u201d Yet, with Future Nostalgia, she says, the name gave the whole thing a more singular vision. \u201cThis time I feel like I\u2019m really finding my feet.\u201d\nBorn in northwest London to Kosovan parents, she moved to Pristina, the Kosovan capital, for her father\u2019s work when she was eleven. Three years later she asked to move back to London: she wanted to attend weekend classes at Sylvia Young Theatre School. She sold it to them by saying she needed A-levels to get into a British university. Back in the UK she started a blog, tried acting and modelling, networking around the city and sending people her demos. She signed a contract in 2013 with Lana Del Rey\u2019s managers, Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, and then a record deal in 2015. \u201cShe signed to Warner Bros partly because they didn\u2019t have a big female pop artist and they needed one,\u201d Millett said in 2018. \u201cThey really wanted her, so she had the focus of the team from day one.\u201d It\u2019s a story of savvy ambition. \u201cIf you assert yourself and you know exactly what you want, people are going to call you a bitch,\u201d Lipa tells me with a shrug. \u201cBut you can\u2019t allow other people\u2019s words to affect your growth.\u201d\nWhile \u201cNew Rules\u201d went viral for all the right reasons, some of her live performances found a less pleasant afterlife online. One 2018 performance of her Calvin Harris collaboration \u201cOne Kiss\u201d, in particular, became a meme due to its awkward choreography: the performance ended up as shorthand for any moment when one is asked to dance or move reluctantly and was even parodied by drag queens \u2013 a sure sign that you\u2019ve entered the cultural lexicon.\n\u00a9 Tung Walsh\nLipa knows what the internet thought of that performance. She even retweeted the jokes. That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t hurtful, though. \u201cOnce you get big enough, everybody wants to see if you can back it up. And rightfully so,\u201d she says, never firmer than when discussing the bargain of success. \u201cBut at the same time, I was learning; I was at the beginning of my career. And so I did feel like it was quite unfair when I started getting hate about certain things \u2013 what I was doing, what my performances were like, what my dancing was like, what my singing was like \u2013 and I felt like I was being picked at from so many angles of my life.\u201d\nAs Lipa would like to point out, women in pop have long been expected to be athletes as much as singers, a bar men are rarely expected to match. \u201cI remember going to a show by...\u201d Lipa pauses and stops herself from naming names, a wry but polite smile crossing her face, \u201c...a male artist that actually doesn\u2019t do anything on stage. And they got this stellar five-star review. But then you have women who get up on stage and they\u2019re practically doing cartwheels, costume changes \u2013 it\u2019s a spectacle. And then [reviewers] nitpick every little thing.\u201d But while Lipa is more than aware of the double standards put on women and musicians from marginalised communities, she\u2019s also not somebody to wallow in self-pity.\n\u201cIt almost seemed like a myth to be able to do everything on stage,\u201d says Lipa, laughing. \u201cI was like, \u2018At least if I can just sing my song really well then nothing else matters.\u2019 But I think now I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact it just has to be all or nothing. It\u2019s made me so much stronger.\u201d Lipa realised she couldn\u2019t release a disco record and not serve visuals and performance alongside, so she practised. A lot. \u201cI sat in a dance studio with Charm La\u2019Donna, my choreographer in LA, for two weeks, just doing the routine over and over again until I literally knew it in my sleep.\u201d\n\u2018The MTV EMAs was the first time when I felt I can do this\u2019\nThe work paid off. A year on from her memed \u201cOne Kiss\u201d performance, Lipa performed \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now\u201d live at the 2019 MTV Europe Music Awards. In three minutes she proved she\u2019d learned to command a stage, with confident dancing, strong vocals and crisp, minimalist staging directed by the incredible Es Devlin (who also designed Lady Gaga\u2019s Monster Ball and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation tours). \u201cThe EMAs,\u201d she says, \u201cwas the first time I felt I can do this.\u201d\nThe performance didn\u2019t just establish her artistic vision: from direction and choreography to vocal coaching and make-up, the entire thing was led by women, something Lipa is fiercely passionate about. Never shy to call out inequality \u2013 during her acceptance speech for Best New Artist at the 2019 Grammys she called out the then Recording Academy president Neil Portnow for previously suggesting women needed to \u201cstep up\u201d if they wanted to be recognised by the awards \u2013 Lipa is now committed to getting more women into roles in music from which they have traditionally been absent.\n\u201cThere is a massive problem \u2013 that maybe starts in schools \u2013 in which girls aren\u2019t necessarily encouraged to play more masculine instruments, aren\u2019t really encouraged to go into production, whereas men naturally fall into that path.\u201d Production and engineering are hugely dominated by men: in a 2016 survey by the Audio Engineering Society, only seven per cent of their members identified as women. Other groups, such as the Women\u2019s Audio Mission, suggest this number is lower.\nWhen I ask Lipa how many women are in the credits for Future Nostalgia, there is a definite pause. \u201cThere are no female producers on the record, which, you know... Hopefully in the future I would be able to work with more of them. I just, in all honesty, don\u2019t know very many. And I really wish I did, because I would really take the time to sit down and hone in a sound with women.\u201d\nLipa loves the men she works with \u2013 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gotten these songs without them\u201d \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t cherish the energy of having other women in the room. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget when I first started going to the studio. I was only 17. I went into rooms that were predominantly male, or a lot older than me, and when I was initially writing I wouldn\u2019t open up as much as I wanted to or wouldn\u2019t express what I wanted to write about because I felt these people had been doing it for longer than me.\u201d\n\u2018If there was more female energy in studios it wouldn\u2019t feel so intimidating\u2019\nBut the women who worked on her first album really helped her to find her voice: people such as Emily Warren and Caroline Ailin, who cowrote \u201cNew Rules\u201d, or Sarah Hudson, who cowrote \u201cGenesis\u201d. \u201cThey really helped me come into myself and be able to write things that come from the heart,\u201d says Lipa. \u201cMy very, very closest friends are all girls. I always feel it\u2019s easier to talk to girls and I\u2019m more open around female energy. Maybe if women in general had a little bit more of that in studios it wouldn\u2019t feel so intimidating to begin with.\u201d\nLipa deserves more credit than she gave herself when we spoke: there are two female producers (Lauren D\u2019Elia and Lorna Blackwood) on the album and a sizeable number of female cowriters \u2013 women cowrote, alongside Lipa, nine of Future Nostalgia\u2019s eleven tracks.\nChelcee Grimes wrote on Lipa\u2019s first album and also on Future Nostalgia (she\u2019s a cowriter on the track \u201cLove Again\u201d) having met her after Lipa\u2019s first record deal. On the first album she cowrote several songs, including \u201cKiss And Make Up\u201d, which was left off the tracklist of the original release. Grimes loved it, pitched it to others \u2013 Demi Lovato, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus \u2013 but, she says, \u201cThey thought the lyrics were too young.\u201d Then, a year-and-a-half later, Lipa\u2019s people came back to her. They were going to do it as a collaboration with K-pop sensation Blackpink \u2013 it now has more than 300 million streams on Spotify. \u201cFor [Lipa] it was an important record, because it was just me and her and then we brought on the Blackpink girls,\u201d says Grimes. \u201cDua\u2019s all for the girls.\u201d\nUnderestimated but ultimately successful female-written pop songs have a habit of following Lipa around. \u201cNew Rules\u201d, the song that changed her self-titled album from a good debut into a worldwide smash, had been recorded long before it became Lipa\u2019s first UK No1. Cowriter Warren feels that the song ripped up the rule book of what was expected for women in pop. \u201cWhen I first got signed and came out to LA, I was working with a seasoned male writer and he told me that whenever you write a lyric you should make sure the guy doesn\u2019t think he isn\u2019t going to \u2018get it\u2019,\u201d she says, sighing. \u201c\u2018New Rules\u2019 was such a cool moment for all of us: it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d\n\u2018If I followed stan culture, I\u2019d probably try to remake \u201cNew Rules\u201d over and over\u2019\nGrimes says that often it\u2019s not just men that can make life difficult for women in the industry. \u201cI\u2019ve heard management or agents say, \u2018Oh, she doesn\u2019t like working with girls,\u2019\u201d she tells me. \u201cI know top-liners who write the biggest songs of the year and won\u2019t wear make-up because artists will feel threatened. Sometimes it\u2019s the girls who make us dilute ourselves.\u201d Lipa, says Grimes, creates a very different energy. \u201cShe\u2019s about closeness and togetherness of everything. I respect Dua a lot.\u201d\nLauren D\u2019Elia, one of the album\u2019s only two female producers, was brought in to help deliver a very specific sound to the album track \u201cHallucinate\u201d. She was picked, she thinks, because of her work with Kaytranada and producing his female collaborators\u2019 vocal performances. D\u2019Elia says that when female artists enter the room, she is usually the first female vocal producer they\u2019ve worked with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak for Dua, but I\u2019ve heard from other artists that there is this comfort that comes from seeing a female in my position,\u201d she explained. \u201cRecording vocals is a very intimate thing. An artist shows you their imperfect side \u2013 it\u2019s everything before it\u2019s a perfect song. Being a woman, a younger woman, there\u2019s this wall that comes down immediately.\u201d\n\u00a9 Tung Walsh\nWas I right to put the onus on her, I ask her collaborators, or should that question be aimed at the label, the management or anybody else, rather than a woman working on her second album in a difficult industry?\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably a little bit of both,\u201d says \u201cPretty Please\u201d cowriter Julia Michaels. \u201cThe artist is in the public eye. They\u2019re a role model to a lot of people and they want to set an example. It\u2019s up to the label to agree to do those things.\u201d Ali Tamposi \u2013 who cowrote \u201cBreak My Heart\u201d \u2013 argues that it needs to fall on labels and management: \u201cThe artists have their focus, performance, so I don\u2019t think the awareness is fully there of which female songwriters are on the rise.\u201d\n\u2018I needed an album I was really proud of, without the opinion of others\u2019\nThere\u2019s no doubt listening to Future Nostalgia that Lipa is a pop star who has found exactly the artist she wants to be \u2013 the way she wants to perform, the music she wants to make, the culture she wants to nurture \u2013 in part because she took herself off Twitter and outside of stan culture (the fickle loving and loathing of women in pop music). \u201cI needed to create an album that I was really proud of, without the opinion of other people,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I stayed online and tried to follow the guidelines of stan culture, I\u2019d probably be trying to remake \u2018New Rules\u2019 over and over again.\u201d\nThe response to her new sound has been huge. The doubters have realised Lipa is the pop star she knows she can be. \u201cEven after I got Best New Artist at the Grammys, I think everybody maybe expected me to fall. But, like I said, I think I\u2019m meant to be here.\u201d\nLipa has always been sold as a deeply ambitious pop star, one who isn\u2019t afraid to let you know how much she wants this. But what \u201cthis\u201d is has clearly evolved, matured and been refined. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve grown so much as a person. Future Nostalgia has opened a door for me mentally that\u2019s helped me understand what I want.\u201d You just have to watch her perform to see this isn\u2019t only hot air. We\u2019re seeing the second stage of a truly great pop talent.\nThat is part of the charm of Future Nostalgia-era Lipa. Nobody can doubt now she deserves her success, because her drive helped to make something so fun, so sexy and so undeniably her. \u201cSometimes people would be like, \u2018Oh, you know, maybe you\u2019re not ready for it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I know that I was born to do this. And I know that I\u2019m exactly where I\u2019m meant to be.\u2019\u201d At these words, there\u2019s adamantium resolve in Lipa\u2019s doe eyes, the look of a woman who has found her sound and has no plans to let it go. \u201cThis was all just part of my learning phase.\u201d\nDownload to read the full June issue now.\nSubscribe now to get one year of GQ for only \u00a312, with free home delivery.\nFor more information on how you can help NHS charities visit nhscharitiestogether.co.uk\nDua Lipa's Future Nostalgia is out now.\nHead to GQ's Vero channel for exclusive music content and commentary, all the latest music lifestyle news and insider access into the GQ world, from behind-the-scenes insight to recommendations from our editors and high-profile talent.\nNow read\nJohn Legend: \u2018We\u2019ve treated black people unfairly for the entirety of our nation\u2019s history\u2019\nDua Lipa: One billion people can't be wrong\nHow Doja Cat broke the internet", "original_url": "https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/dua-lipa-interview-2020", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200506215853/https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/dua-lipa-interview-2020", "a_id": "Q27916123-14"}
