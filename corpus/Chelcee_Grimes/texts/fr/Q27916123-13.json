{"title": "Chelcee Grimes\u2019 Summer of Pride Playlist: Listen", "text": "Chelcee Grimes\u2019 Summer of Pride Playlist: Listen\nChelcee Grimes is a very special breed of triple threat. As one of today\u2019s freshest solo voices, the Liverpool pop newcomer has earned a global audience on the heels of her latest left-of-center hits, from \u201cJust Like That\u201d and \u201cI Need a Night Out\u201d to her biggest feature to date \u201cWild,\u201d on Jonas Blue\u2019s 2018 LP Blue, which also included guest spots by Joe Jonas, Liam Payne, Jack & Jack and more. Behind the decks, Chelcee has also found success as a top songwriter for other artists including Olly Murs, Little Mix, Zara Larsson and Dua Lipa. On the latter\u2019s eponymous debut LP, she inked three songwriting credits: on \u201cDreams,\u201d \u201cBad Together\u201d and \u201cKiss and Make Up\u201d featuring BLACKPINK, which has surpassed 300 million streams across platforms.\nThe 27-year-old talent\u2019s first love, though, is the U.K. sport of football (read: soccer). A born-and-bred footballer since she was a teen, she has played for local teams Everton, Tottenham, Tranmere and currently reps Fulham FC. She\u2019s since taken on the role of on-camera presenter for BBC and Copa90, and even inked her own show with BBC Sport \u2014 dubbed Chelcee Away \u2014 in which she brings her music friends to football games, as well as branded partnerships wtih Adidas, Nike and New Balance.\nWithout making any concessions in her career, the queer upstart is finally in full-on thrive mode. Her latest solo single \u201cGirls\u201d arrived this April. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing like the shape of our body, make a grown man shake and we\u2019re not sorry,\u201d she spits on the feminist cut. \u201cWe\u2019re always full of surprises, mothers and daughters.\u201d The track is about self-acceptance at its core, but doubles as an anthem for girls who like girls. \u201cThis is for all of us girls around the world,\u201d she wrote on Twitter after the track\u2019s release. \u201cWork with what you got girls, you\u2019re all bloody beautiful.\u201d\nAs part of Billboard\u2019s Summer of Pride, Chelcee put together a Pride-themed playlist, comprised of her favorite same-sex love anthems of all time, plus a few nods to her own songwriting discography.\nFor Chelcee, it all began with Russian pop duo t.A.T.u.\u2019s classic 2002 gay anthem \u201cAll the Things She Said.\u201d \u201cI remember this song, but I\u2019m not sure why!\u201d she admits. (The duo performed the hit at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in what was an iconic primetime television moment for the LGBTQ community.) \u201cI was so young when it was released but I loved it. I didn\u2019t realize until many years later that it was a gay anthem, because I\u2019m not sure I ever really paid attention to the video. Now it all makes sense why I loved it so much.\u201d\nNext up, another ubiquitous gay anthem makes the cut: Lady Gaga\u2019s 2011 single (and album title track) \u201cBorn This Way.\u201d \u201cI love Lady Gaga. She was my biggest inspiration growing up because she\u2019s the first artist in my generation I saw on the big screen really standing for something and the support she gave to the LGBT community was amazing,\u201d says Grimes. \u201cShe really helped me growing through adolescence to feel a little more ok in my skin and knowing I wasn\u2019t alone. She\u2019s just incredible. My dream is to one day write with her. I actually wrote a few songs with [producer] REDONE (\u201cJust Dance\u201d \u201cPoker Face\u201d) on my last L.A. trip & to see all the records hanging from the wall they made together which were a huge part of my growth as a writer was just one of those pinch myself moments.\u201d\nA surprise on the set is Bonnie Raitt\u2019s 1991 hit \u201cI Can\u2019t Make You Love Me,\u201d a sad-bop that has earned a new life as a queer love anthem. \u201cI always thought this was one of the best songs I\u2019d ever ever heard when I started writing music and really listened to lyric & melody in a new way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I remember my first breakup with my first ever girlfriend and she wasn\u2019t ready to \u2018come out.\u2019 It was tough because no matter how much you love somebody if they aren\u2019t ready, they aren\u2019t ready. I was so heartbroken and this song come on the radio one night when I was driving through London in the rain. I just started crying like a baby! Ahhh, I\u2019m almost welling up now. What a song!\u201d\nNext up is one of Chelcee\u2019s own cuts: Tom Walker\u2019s \u201cNow You\u2019re Gone,\u201d featuring Zara Larsson. The songwriter penned the track about her last relationship. \u201cIt was so toxic,\u201d she adds of the \u2018secret\u2019 relationship. \u201cI was madly in love, and I\u2019d constantly say I\u2019d leave and was done with the situation but felt helpless when I\u2019d end it. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Tom already had the chorus and in 10 minutes I had the whole verse Zara now sings. It was one of those songs that wrote itself. It was completely honest.\u201d\nLastly, Chelcee recalls an iconic artist who gave her her first ever \u201cbreak\u201d as a songwriter \u2014 on the Kylie Minogue track \u201cMillion Miles\u201d (off her 2014 LP Kiss Me Once). Kylie is \u201cobviously a gay icon,\u201d she says, adding that \u201cevery guy in the UK who I know is obsessed with her. She\u2019s a Queen!\u201d On the day of the track\u2019s release, Chelcee remembers getting about \u201c500 text messages\u201d from friends and industry contacts. \u201cThe whole of her fan base really supported me and were so lovely. That\u2019s why she\u2019s such a household name, she\u2019s always been great to her fans and they\u2019ve done the same to her.\u201d\nGive Chelcee\u2019s full Pride playlist a spin below \u2014 featuring further tracks by Katy Perry (\u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d), King Princess (\u201c1950\u201d) and LP (\u201cLost on You\u201d) \u2014 and catch the rising star at Manchester Pride in the U.K. later this summer (Aug. 24-25), performing alongside Ariana Grande, Years & Years, Basement Jaxx, Pixie Lott and more.", "original_url": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/politics/chelcee-grimes-summer-of-pride-playlist-8515199/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211210104851/https://www.billboard.com/culture/politics/chelcee-grimes-summer-of-pride-playlist-8515199/", "a_id": "Q27916123-13"}
