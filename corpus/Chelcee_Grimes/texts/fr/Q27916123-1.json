I can\u2019t wait to show Liverpool has something else other than The Beatles.\n\u201cI know I\u2019ll never be as big as them but I can\u2019t wait for the day when people say \u2018I\u2019m from Liverpool where Chelcee Grimes is from\u2019. I\u2019ll die happy then.\u201d\nChelcee gave up playing for Liverpool Ladies FC to concentrate on singing and writing music.\nShe said: \u201cI chose music just to fill my options up at school when I was 16. I used to play football but then music came about and I fell in love with everything about it.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m having a hard time at home and my mum\u2019s telling me to wash my plate the studio is a place I can think about music.\n\u201cI used to be in the ECHO for being a top goal scorer, now I\u2019m in for my music. I love it.\n\u201cI gave up football when I had only been doing music for two months.\n\u201cI dropped out of college because I had to make singing my priority. My mum Maria and dad David were really supportive.\u201d\nChelcee, who is originally from Aigburth, is expected to battle it out in the charts against the X Factor\u2019s Cher Lloyd.\nThe former St Julie's High School student has written and recorded most of her debut album which will be released later this year.\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m not someone who is trying to be famous. It\u2019s not the X Factor, it is real life.\n\u201cI love the X Factor but that\u2019s like jumping on a trampoline rather than climbing the ladder.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard and I really appreciate everything that is happening.\u201d\nPop singer Chelcee is managed by Martin O\u2019Shea who discovered Atomic Kitten.\nShe said: \u201cI always joke that when I was a kid I used to sit in my bedroom and sing along to The Tide is High.\n\u201cNow I\u2019m in their presence and I have a record deal. It is exciting.\u201d\nCharlie Lycett, MD of RCA, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have signed Chelcee and believe she\u2019s an incredible talent.\u201d", "original_url": "https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/wavertree-teenager-chelcee-grimes-lands-3376810", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200918211529/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/wavertree-teenager-chelcee-grimes-lands-3376810", "a_id": "Q27916123-1"}
