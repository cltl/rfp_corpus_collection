But he\u2019s now 64 and just finished a world tour that made his band richer by $437 million. Arnel Pineda has just turned 40 and the roller-coaster ride that has marked his profession as a rock singer is about to take a new turn. On Feb. 1 he will fly to the United States to start rehearsing and recording as the new vocalist of Journey -- the American band famous for its power ballads, and whose records have sold 75 million copies since 1973. Landing the slot wasn\u2019t exactly the biggest deal of his life. \u201cAt least [not] in the first few days after Neal Schon (Journey founder and lead guitarist) told me I was their new man,\u201d Pineda said Wednesday in an interview at the Greenhills office of his manager, TV director Bert de Leon. Pineda recalled telling himself, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a very secure job; they can fire me anytime.\u201d But the thrill of everything that lay ahead -- performing as a Filipino musician who would certainly make his countrymen proud sank in soon enough. \u201cI thought my Friendster account would explode with the volume of e-mail that poured in from Filipinos based in the US and Europe,\u201d Pineda recounted. \u201cBut here at home, there was little noise about it. Lately na lang.\u201d No greenhorn Standing a bit too short at 5-foot-3 to look like a rock star, Pineda isn\u2019t exactly a greenhorn in the scene. He has logged in 25 years of singing with various local bands that earned their keep by performing all-cover repertoires. \u201cI felt I had become the Willie Nepomuceno of [Pinoy rock],\u201d he quipped. And this is no laughing matter. Pineda can sing almost exactly like Journey\u2019s Steve Perry, and also deftly tackles Freddie Mercury (Queen), Sting (The Police), David Lee Roth (Van Halen), Bono (U2), and Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin) -- among many others. His mean cover of Led Zep\u2019s \u201cBlack Dog\u201d has been uploaded on YouTube along with Steve Perry covers that had helped make up Schon\u2019s mind. Young blood The now famous story making the Internet rounds is that Schon -- whose guitar prowess earlier earned him an invitation to join Eric Clapton\u2019s band Derek and the Dominos in the 1970s (Schon joined Santana instead \u201cbecause he called first.\u201d) -- was desperate to find a new singer for Journey, which was still very active on the concert circuit, touring at least six months a year. Schon wanted young blood and was trolling from so many videos on YouTube, but couldn\u2019t find anyone that impressed him. \u201cIt was actually his girlfriend who stumbled upon our video,\u201d said Pineda, referring to the clip in which he sang Journey\u2019s \u201cFaithfully\u201d with his band, The Zoo. The video was shot by a friend from Olongapo City who had attended the band\u2019s gig at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Makati. It was uploaded on YouTube for posterity. After Schon saw the video, he lost no time in hooking up with Pineda. The rest is history: Pineda flew to San Francisco for a two-day audition, at one point jamming for three hours with Schon and other Journey members Jonathan Cain (keyboards), Ross Valery (bass) and Deen Castronovo (drums). \u201cI had had two hours of sleep and was very nervous when I played with the band,\u201d Pineda said. \u201cI was sure I blew it; I was even croaking in some parts. But they gave me a study tape of two new songs, and we recorded some demos of their old songs. Then Neal said, \u2018You got the gig, man.\u2019\u201d Target: a Grammy Pineda has yet to sign contracts and is letting De Leon, who was also manager of The Zoo, handle legal matters. A new Journey album is reportedly in the works, to be produced by Kevin Shirley (known for his work with Aerosmith, Rush, Iron Maiden, The Black Crowes and Led Zeppelin), and due out in July. \u201cThere will still be power ballads, plus upbeat tracks,\u201d said Pineda. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming for a Grammy.\u201d It\u2019s definitely been a long, uh, journey for the Sampaloc, Manila-born Pineda, who experienced abject poverty at age 12, after his mother\u2019s death from heart disease. His parents were both tailors. \u201cWe used up all our money on my mother\u2019s treatment. When she died, my three siblings and myself (he\u2019s the eldest) had to part ways.\u201d For a year Pineda lived like a vagrant, sleeping in friends\u2019 homes and sometimes on benches at Rizal Park. Pineda has also gone through the whole sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll lifestyle but is now very conscious of his health. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep singing for the next 10 years,\u201d Pineda mused. \u201cI would like to serve as a door for others, like Bamboo, to break into the global rock scene. We\u2019ve made it in pop music.\u201d The Pinoy rocker\u2019s baptism of fire with his new band mates is at the Festival de Vi\u00f1a del Mar in Chile, on Feb. 21. \u201970s Jukebox Queen The latest example of a Pinoy pop artist possibly on the brink of worldwide attention is 1970s Jukebox Queen Claire de la Fuente, who recently recorded an album in the US with a lineup of musicians identified with Barbra Streisand, Michael Jackson and Josh Groban. The album, whose title track, \u201cSomething in Your Eyes,\u201d was originally composed by Richard Carpenter (of the brother/sister duo The Carpenters) and sung by Dusty Springfield in 1982, has gained praise from Carpenter himself, who welcomed De la Fuente in his home last December and has committed to come to Manila for the record launch in February. De la Fuente, also known as the Karen Carpenter of the Philippines, said Richard had likewise agreed to compose a new song for her next album. Austrian exposure Still another Filipino, 22-year-old Vincent Bueno, is poised to break into the world pop consciousness with his outstanding performance in \u201cMusical Die Show,\u201d a reality talent program in Austria. Bueno has landed in the magic five finalists, with the final showdown on Friday.\n\u00a92008 www.inquirer.net all rights reserved Send your feedback here", "original_url": "http://services.inquirer.net/express/08/01/10/html_output/xmlhtml/20080110-111456-xml.html", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080120125117/http://services.inquirer.net:80/express/08/01/10/html_output/xmlhtml/20080110-111456-xml.html", "a_id": "Q700468-1"}
