On Mail on Sunday, he shows flashes of virtually every point in the history of Florida hip-hop, from Miami bass, 2 Live Crew, and Poison Clan to Trick Daddy and Rick Ross. Though Flo Rida has his own identity -- for all the tough talk and the automotives fixation, he does come off as big-hearted, and he could just as easily make an R&B; album -- and covers more bases than what is typical from other mainstream-yet-street rap albums of 2007 and 2008, he's not nearly as distinctive as any of his predecessors. Here, he doesn't offer much more than a couple worthy singles and a handful of decent album cuts, and those highlights, such as the Timbaland-produced (and hogged) \"Elevator,\" tend to be memorable more for the beats and the hooks than the rhymes.", "original_url": "http://www.allmusic.com/album/mail-on-sunday-mw0000504619", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120706012632/http://www.allmusic.com:80/album/mail-on-sunday-mw0000504619", "a_id": "Q213538-14"}
