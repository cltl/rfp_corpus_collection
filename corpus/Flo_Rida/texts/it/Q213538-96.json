And what do you do when you want a hit song? Call up Flo Rida.\nJeremih just dropped \"Tonight Belongs to U!\" featuring Flo Rida on Monday (April 6) afternoon. If the exclamation point wasn't enough of a tip-off, \"Tonight Belongs to U!\" is a high-energy banger with a chorus readymade for fist-pumping.\nThe Juice Podcast: Jeremih Talks 'Late Night' Album\nThis new song comes in the same sleek, electronic R&B packaging as his recent hit YG collabo \"Don't Tell 'Em\" (which peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100 in fall of 2014), although that was a far more laid-back track. Both come from his upcoming Late Nights: The Album album, slated for this spring.\nAs per his reclusive M.O., Jeremih hasn't tweeted about the new song, opting to retweet Def Jam's tweet about the single premiere instead.", "original_url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6524239/jeremih-flo-rida-tonight-belongs-to-u", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150407142557/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6524239/jeremih-flo-rida-tonight-belongs-to-u", "a_id": "Q213538-96"}
