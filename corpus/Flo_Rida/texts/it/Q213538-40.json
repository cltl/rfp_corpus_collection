It\u2019s called Dirty Mind and it\u2019s all about how your mind is constantly in the gutter, thinking about getting *giggity* with an S/O or rando instead of the important things in life, like your 401k or the deductible on your health insurance plan.\nIt\u2019s a full-throttle banger that\u2019s going to be everywhere in a couple days.\nAnd we\u2019re lucky enough here at BroBible to be the first to present it to the world. That\u2019s right, we\u2019ve copped the super exclusive world premiere of Flo Rida\u2019s new dance anthem. Go buy it tomorrow on iTunes here.\nAtlantic Records\nBruh get your mind out of the gutter. #dirtymind cc @official_flo ufilthy A video posted by BroBible.com (@brobible) on Dec 3, 2015 at 11:58am PST\nCome on now! #dirtymind @official_flo A video posted by BroBible.com (@brobible) on Dec 3, 2015 at 12:01pm PST", "original_url": "http://www.brobible.com/entertainment/music/article/flo-rida-new-single-dirty-mind/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20151208022844/http://www.brobible.com/entertainment/music/article/flo-rida-new-single-dirty-mind/", "a_id": "Q213538-40"}
