However, today, July 21, I found out there\u2019s still hope for Pitbull\u2019s new era. Today the Cuban-American rapper dropped a new single called \u201cGreen Light\u201d and, ladies and gentleman, it is is BLAZING FIRE! One of the 2016 summer\u2019s biggest hits: I\u2019m calling it right now!\nFeaturing fellow Miami boys Flo Rida and LunchMoney Lewis, \u201cGreen Light\u201d is a feel-good, uptempo EDM-urban jam you will fall in love with the second you hear that soothing saxophone in the intro. Pretty amazing how a simple saxophone melody can make a kinda generic song become a monster-sounding hit, huh?\n\u201cGive me the green light / Let's have a good time, let's go / What you waiting for / You only got one life\u201d, sings LunchMoney Lewis, very Ne-Yo-ly, in the chorus of Pitbull\u2019s new single - a song about making that girl you\u2019re digging realize that you are the man of her life and there is no time to waste.\nPitbull\u2019s energetic verse? Check! Flo Rida\u2019s fast-pace killer verse? Check! A pretty fine and catchy chorus? Check! An infectious production with some saxophone in it? Check! The result: SMASH HIT.\nNow gimme \"Climate Change\"! This is what I'm talking about!\nHit or Miss?", "original_url": "https://www.directlyrics.com/world-premiere-pitbull-flo-rida-lunchmoney-lewis-green-light-full-audio-review-news.html", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160725055729/http://www.directlyrics.com:80/world-premiere-pitbull-flo-rida-lunchmoney-lewis-green-light-full-audio-review-news.html", "a_id": "Q213538-98"}
