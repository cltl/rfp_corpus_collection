{"title": "Flo Rida on GDFR Single", "text": "Flo Rida on GDFR Single\nBillboard caught up with Flo Rida to talk about his latest hit, \"G.D.F.R.,\" which is currently at No. 34 on the Hot 100.\nThe song is called \"G.D.F.R.,\" or \"Going Down for Real.\" Why abbreviate it?\nI mean, it's a lot of words? (Laughs.) At the same time, we just wanted something that would be eye-catching and different when it came to iTunes and promo, when you just see it. We just wanted it to remind you of graffiti, where people would be like, \"What's that?\"\nHow long does it take you to write a hit?\nMan, you never know! I have patience with records because I know if I don't work hard on it, you get to thinking, \"What happened? There's so much I could've done.\" I recall doing the [2008 Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper] \"Low\" in a couple of hours, though, so it varies.\nFlo Rida's 'Low' Continues To Rule Hot 100\nIn addition to recording your album The Perfect 10, you also are releasing an EP. Why do both?\nThe EP is part of Perfect 10. We're going to release a few songs, come back around and then give you the rest. To create a perfect project, you have to make sure that every record gives back to the fans. I want people to know I'm different, and that what inspired me in the beginning still inspires me today.\nThis story first appeared in the Feb. 7 issue of Billboard.", "original_url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6458305/flo-rida-gdrf-single-new-album", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150205031451/http://www.billboard.com:80/articles/news/6458305/flo-rida-gdrf-single-new-album", "a_id": "Q213538-93"}
