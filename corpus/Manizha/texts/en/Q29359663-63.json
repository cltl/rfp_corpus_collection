However, we have not received any formal confirmation from our Members at this moment.\nThe EBU was informed by RTR on Friday that this could be the outcome of suspending Russia from this year\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest. However, in light of the unprecedented crisis unfolding in Ukraine, our Executive Board still felt that the inclusion of the Russian entry in this year\u2019s event would undermine the values of the Contest and bring the competition into disrepute.\nOur Union is committed to upholding the values of public service media and, as this conflict escalates, our priority must be to ensure all citizens continue to have access to trusted, independent news and information and that journalists are allowed to report freely and safely.\nWe stand with all our Members who are working under extremely challenging circumstances to bring impartial reporting to their audiences - supporting media freedom must now be a priority for all sides in this conflict.", "original_url": "https://www.ebu.ch/news/2022/02/ebu-statement-on-rtr-and-channel-one-membership", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220226172147/https://www.ebu.ch/news/2022/02/ebu-statement-on-rtr-and-channel-one-membership", "a_id": "Q29359663-63"}
