{"title": "First Spin: Montaigne lets fly on the eruptive 'Love Might Be Found (Volcano)'", "text": "First Spin: Montaigne lets fly on the eruptive 'Love Might Be Found (Volcano)'\nMontaigne is releasing her second album at the end of the month, which we're most looking forward to. It's called Complex, and today, we've got another reason to get excited for it - new track 'Love Might Be Found (Volcano)'.\nIt's a denser, synth-driven moment than the sparse and strange lead single \u2018For Your Love\u2019 and percussive 'Ready', and Montaigne really lets her vocals fly as she sings about eruptive emotions like they're forces of nature.\n'I could go some thunder now/ I could go some rain or snow or a volcano/ Keep me from leaving now,\" she declares against metallic beats and cutting keys. Listen below.\nThe song reunites Montaigne with Tony Buchen, the producer from Glorious Heights, her J Award nom'd and ARIA winning 2016 debut album. But she also hooked up with a new collaborator, Wynne Bennett.\nA producer, arranger, and lyricist, Bennett was all over Janelle Mon\u00e1e's Dirty Computer and is a long-term collaborator for Twin Shadow, Bennett and Montaigne met bonded over a mutual love for Bj\u00f6rk's song 'Enjoy', but also Sophie Ellis-Bextor.\n\"I\u2019m really proud of how it came out. It\u2019s like my version of \u2018Groovejet\u2019 by Spiller \u2013 the narrative are sort of parallel to each other,\" the Sydney-based artist told Music Feed.\nComplex is out 30 August, and Montaigne is taking the record around the country on tour in November with special guests Miss Blanks and Stevie Jean.
