Thrilled I still get to compete but bummed that I don\u2019t get to take advantage of that gigantic Eurovision stage.\nAustralian Eurovision acts, in general, have always had to build fanbases in advance of the Contest from afar - do you think this gives #TeamMontaigne an advantage when it comes to adaptability?\nThe answer\u2019s in the question I think. We\u2019ve always been campaigning from a distance and so the only thing about the situation that changes here is where the performance is taking place, which I think we have adapted nicely and I\u2019m excited for everyone to see it! Campaigning will simply go on happening!\nMontaigne She Is Aphrodite\nWhat\u2019s your personal philosophy about situations like this?\nI have the preternatural ability to let go of opportunities that don\u2019t come through. Like water off a duck\u2019s back. I could go into my past that has birthed this resilience in me but wouldn\u2019t that be long and boring, ha!\nIn Technicolour you touch upon a lot of subjects; vulnerability, togetherness, courage\u2026. do the lyrics now take on extra meaning regarding the new challenges we face during the COVID-19 pandemic?\nAbsolutely! The greatest thing that I have learnt during this time has been the concept of mutual aid, which is really just an encapsulation of the notion that humanity needs to work together in order to survive. We need to care about each other too, survive not just for ourselves but for love and love of others, and that\u2019s how we get through something like a pandemic together.\nCompeting from home opens up an exciting new question: who will be joining you in the green room?\nMy partner, Pat! Of course. My family - my mum, dad, and sister, I\u2019m sure\u2026.and a handful of my closest friends and my managers.\nWhat are you most looking forward to during Eurovision week?\nCelebrating the year and a half that has been with my people! It\u2019s important to honour the time and effort spent on creative projects. I\u2019m so excited to see people\u2019s reactions from all across the world too. I can\u2019t wait.\nMontaigne will compete in the first Semi-Final on Tuesday 18 May.\nRead more: What is a \u2018live-on-tape\u2019 performance?\nPress release: Australia to compete from home using \u2018live-on-tape\u2019 performance", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/story/montaigne-q-and-a", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420060248/https://eurovision.tv/story/montaigne-q-and-a", "a_id": "Q19666292-18"}
