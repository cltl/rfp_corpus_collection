Regarding her and Montaigne\u2019s collaboration, she said the pair had first met at a writing camp in 2018, and reconnected in 2020 for a few sessions \u2013 one of which resulted in \u2018One Long Firework In The Sky\u2019.\n\u201cIn our sessions, we spend a lot of time talking about life and our common interests. She\u2019s absurdly talented and such a uniquely interesting artist; it\u2019s an honour to work with her,\u201d Ninajirachi continued. In her own statement, Montaigne said it was \u201csuch a privilege\u201d to work with the producer, saying they share \u201ca lot of the same sensibilities\u201d.

When announcing the hyperpop-leaning project, the songwriter said they had aimed to make a \u201ccomputer record\u201d that still felt \u201cwarm in places\u201d and \u201cinnately human\u201d. In a four-star review, NME said Montaigne had not only \u201cpulled that off without a hitch\u201d but that \u201cin a paradoxical way, \u2018Making It!\u2019 is actually Montaigne\u2019s most human record yet\u201d.", "original_url": "https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/listen-to-ninajirachi-and-montaignes-new-single-one-long-firework-in-the-sky-3331585", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20221019083523/https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/listen-to-ninajirachi-and-montaignes-new-single-one-long-firework-in-the-sky-3331585", "a_id": "Q19666292-71"}
