She adds that his influence extends beyond just fronting Talking Heads and his solo work, crediting his book How Music Works as a \"groundbreaking read [and] totally changed how I approached live performance.\"\n\"I've always resonated as well with - maybe more than any other artist I've witnessed - the sort of demeanour, tone, and sense of humour that David's carried himself with as an artist.\"\nThe influential frontman offers both his distinctive vocals and presence, appearing in the accompanying music video, which was directed by Jacinthe Lau and Sydney artist (and another Unearthed fave) Nick Ward.

How could I have not been aware of this person? Someone I imagine might occasionally get labelled \u2018quirky\u2019-as I often am.\n\"...With Jess that quirkiness translates into complete heartfelt honesty and transparency about her feelings - feelings many of us might be ashamed or afraid to admit to - all set to incredibly infectious tunes. Brave, weird and catchy.
