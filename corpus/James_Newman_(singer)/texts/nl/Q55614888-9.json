From Lorde to Adele, The Weeknd to John Legend, stars of the charts often write their best songs with other people - songwriters whose names you may not know, but whose musical influence runs far and wide.\nSongHubs Auckland brings this experience to New Zealand, with platinum-selling, Grammy Award winning, Billboard #1 songwriters Mike Elizondo, Emily Warren andJames Newman travelling from the UK and US for an intensive five day song-writing workshop at Auckland\u2019s Roundhead Studios, from February 27 to March 4.\nMike Elizondo is perhaps best known for his work with Eminem, co-writing number 1 hit The Real Slim Shady, along with much of the rest of The Marshall Mathers LP. But his co-writing credits range far and wide, from hip hop greats Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg, to Twenty One Pilots, Maroon 5, Tegan & Sarah, Regina Spektor, and two of New Zealand\u2019s favourite songbirds, Gin Wigmore, and Kimbra.\nEmily Warren is having a stellar year, having helped The Chainsmokers win a Grammy yesterday for Don't Let Me Down, as well as achieving international stardom and chart success (they\u2019re currently sitting at #5 and #16 in the NZ Top 40). Warren has not only co-written three songs with the American DJ duo, but her vocals also feature on two tracks \u2013 Until You Were Gone, and Paris. Aside from that she\u2019s worked with Jessie J, Shawn Mendez, 5 Seconds of Summer, Tiesto, Fifth Harmony, Sean Paul, and a host of others.\nJames Newman is the unassuming older brother of rising British dance-soul star John Newman, and has spent the past few years working as a key collaborator with Rudimental (for which he won a Brit Award), as well as working with Calvin Harris, Ella Eyre, and David Guetta, while also working on his own material, which looks set to be released this year.\nWe also have local hip hop and pop producer star Pete Wadams aka P-Money joining the team. P-Money is known for his many collaborations, including his current smash hit with Starley Hope, Call On Me (which is in the Top 10 throughout Europe and has had more than 230 million streams), plus chart topping classics written with Scribe, Vince Harder, and Akon, as well as his own work as a producer and songwriter.\n\u201cHaving this calibre of international artists come together to share their talent, knowledge and experience with our songwriters is totally unprecedented in New Zealand, and a huge opportunity for our writers.\u201d says APRA\u2019s Manager of NZ Member Services Victoria Kelly. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the music that will come from these collaborations, the seeds that will be sown for our artists, the relationships they\u2019ll build, and the fact that it\u2019s all happening here in Auckland.\u201d\nWe\u2019re also very pleased to announce the list of impressive local artists who will spend the week writing new songs with Elizondo, Warren, Newman, and Wadams:\nBenny Tipene\nChelsea Jade\nDave Baxter\nDiaz Grimm\nEcca Vandal\nEstere\nIva Lamkum\nMitch James\nNik Brinkman\nPossum Plows\nRaiza Biza\nTeeks\nThey will be joined by local producers Josh Fountain, Djiesan Suskov, and Sam de Jong for the week.\nPlease contact us for info and biographies on all participants.\nParticipants have been selected by SongHubs Auckland curator, producer Greg Haver(Manic Street Preachers, Catatonia, Pluto)\nSongHubs is an APRA AMCOS initiative, supported by the Federal Government of Australia. In addition to APRA AMCOS, SongHubs Auckland has been made possible with the support of NZ On Air, Auckland Council, Recorded Music NZ and the New Zealand Music Commission.\n//ends//\n\u00a9 Scoop Media", "original_url": "https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1702/S00272/international-hit-makers-coming-to-work-with-kiwi-artists.htm", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170215010251/http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1702/S00272/international-hit-makers-coming-to-work-with-kiwi-artists.htm", "a_id": "Q55614888-9"}
