The local news and entertainment site Super has now published a list of supposed candidates for next weeks show. The list of supposed acts shortlisted is as followed:\n#2\u00d0\u009c\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u0088\u00d0\u00b8\nAnton Belyaev\nNiletto\nMORGENSTERN\nEgor Kreed\nSuper stated Little Big may not take part in Russia upcoming National Final for Eurovision 2021 with Channel One reportedly being unhappy with the musical material the group had submitted. Of the list of acts reported by Super, Morgenstern has stated his interest previously in competing in Eurovision.\nLittle Big, had already revealed in an interview with Radio Energy in November of 2020 that they will submit a song for the 2021 contest but that they had not been automatically been reselected for Eurovision 2021. Super however also stated that the group was still working on a song that could be entered at the last minute, meaning the current question if Little Big would take part or not is still unknown.\nEarlier this week the news site Eurovision Fun reported that sources inside Channel had claimed the group would not take part in the upcoming national final. Eurovision Fun later stated that the other newer sources have supplied information that contradicts the original source.\u00c2 It is still unknown if Little Big will or won\u2019t take part in the show, so far no official confirmation has been made.\nThe national final is due to take place on Channel One on March the 8th. The show is due to only last for one hour meaning a short number of acts will likely be involved. Moldova\u2019s 2021 Eurovision singer Natalia Gordienko will also perform her 2021 Eurovision entry \u201cSuger\u201d as an interval act.\nTo date, Ben & Tan are the only officially known 2020 act who attempted to participate again in 2021 but were rejected by their broadcaster. Some artists, such as THE ROOP in Lithuania were given an automatic place in the final of their National Selection, as well as Ulrikke in Norway. The former accepted this offer and promptly won, while the latter refused the offer and did not compete.\nSource: Super/\u00c2 Image Source: Wikimedia\nRussia in the Eurovision Song Contest Russia debuted in Eurovision in 1994 and has gone on to be one of the most successful countries in the contest.
