They are then randomly drawn into either the first or second half of the Semi-Final they'd just been placed into.\nThis system has been used since Malm\u00f6 2013, and ensures that while there's still a fair element of randomness in the competition, it's less likely that two or more songs performed successively will be similar.\nThe intention behind moving away from an entirely randomised draw is to craft a more entertaining, better paced show, that allows different styles of song their space to shine.\nThe Semi-Final allocation draw for this Contest took place at Stadhuis Rotterdam in January 2020. It was originally intended to be used for the cancelled 2020 Contest, and remains in place for the 2021 Contest.\nAfter each Semi-Final, successful qualifiers will randomly draw from 'a hat' whether they'll perform in the first or second half of the Grand Final. The full running order for the Grand Final will be confirmed by producers in the wee hours of Friday 21 May, after both Semi-Finals are complete.", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/story/semi-final-running-orders", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210330100028/https://eurovision.tv/story/semi-final-running-orders", "a_id": "Q104882029-0"}
