Apparently she was feeling a little unwell this morning, and COVID-19 rules mean that she now has to wait for the results of a PCR test before she can return to the arena. The other members of the band have all tested negative and are rehearsing with a stand-in singer today. We have our fingers crossed for Kateryna and hope she\u2019ll be back with us soon!", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/live-blog-wednesday-12-may/snippet/fingers-crossed-for-kateryna-from-ukraine", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210512152146/https://eurovision.tv/live-blog-wednesday-12-may/snippet/fingers-crossed-for-kateryna-from-ukraine", "a_id": "Q104439362-6"}
