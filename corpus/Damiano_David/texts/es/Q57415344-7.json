(Some have speculated that the rumor was started by fans of acts who didn\u2019t win the competition.)\nIt was an odd climax for the group \u2014 David, bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi and drummer Ethan Torchio \u2014 who have known each other since middle school and formed the band in 2015. Their unusual name is pronounced \u201cMON-eh-skin,\u201d is Danish for \u201cmoonlight\u201d and pays tribute to De Angelis\u2019 Danish ancestry. The group rose to fame in Italy in 2017 after auditioning for \u201cX-Factor Italia\u201d (for which they came in second) with \u201cChosen,\u201d which was to become their debut single. Bolstered by more hit singles, they quickly became popular on the continent and undertook a 70-date tour in 2019.\nAfter winning Italy\u2019s Sanremo song fest in March and the Eurovision crown on Saturday, M\u00e5neskin pulled off another feat this week: Their song \u201cZitti e Buoni\u201d \u2013 winner of both events \u2013 broke into the Top 10 of the Spotify Global Chart. And the track (the title translates as \u201cShut Up and Behave\u201d) is being touted as having just become the most streamed Italian song ever in one day.\nM\u00e5neskin spoke to Variety on Tuesday about all of the above.\nLet\u2019s get the cocaine incident out of the way. Damiano: how did it make you feel?\nDavid: I was certainly very offended by the incident, because it was a personal attack. If someone had said that my performance sucked, I would have accepted it. But in any event, I obviously wasn\u2019t worried about it, even for a second \u2014 I know the truth and we\u2019ve also provided proof that it was false. Now I just hope that people stop talking about it and we get a chance to celebrate, since they tried to spoil our party. Stuff like this happens, even though it shouldn\u2019t. But we came out of it with our heads held high.\nHow do you feel about \u201cZitti e Buoni\u201d becoming the most-streamed Italian song in one day?\nDavid: Let\u2019s hope we\u2019ve contributed to raise general opinions about Italian music a bit. That aside, we are happy because we\u2019ve done something historic and nobody can take this away from us. It\u2019s amazing!\nIt\u2019s even more remarkable because it\u2019s a rock song sung in Italian \u2014 a long way from the stereotypes about Italy\u2019s music.\nThomas Raggi: The incredible thing, like you said, is that this opens many doors. It\u2019s like when we went to Sanremo. We\u2019ve always believed in rock music and also in singing in Italian. And now we got a lot of appreciation for that: when we saw the votes coming in from the [Eurovision] TV audience, we were blown away!\nVictoria De Angelis: The really great thing is that we came across as being real. [Our music] is something we really believe in and we\u2019re simply ourselves, rather than conforming to the types of music that are more fashionable today.\nYou\u2019ve also done a lot of songs in English \u2014 how do you decide which language a sung should be performed in?\nDe Angelis: Initially, almost all the songs we wrote were in English because writing our type of music in Italian was more difficult. But I like to write in both languages; they are both very important. The fact that lots of doors are now opening up for us internationally gives us more of an opportunity to push out more English-language songs that in Italy are a tougher sell. Though we\u2019ve never really given a shit about this.\nHow important was \u201cX-Factor\u201d for you?\nDe Angelis: It was really important because it allowed us to reach a wider audience for the first time \u2014 it was a sea change in our lives. The really beautiful thing is we lived it very spontaneously and with total lightness, because nobody was telling us what we could [or could not] do. It all came entirely from us. We didn\u2019t know anything yet about the dynamics of the music world. It was total freedom and we could be ourselves. It was a fantastic beginning.\nYou\u2019ll be touring Italy later this year, and you\u2019ve said you\u2019d like to play the Glastonbury festival in England in September \u2014 what else is on the horizon?\nDavid: We are trying to figure out our next moves. A lot of doors are opening that we didn\u2019t even dream of considering possible before. Of course, we want to play for the new audiences we have conquered in lots of countries. We are trying to juggle doing concerts abroad with writing. But, yes, we would love to play at Glastonbury!", "original_url": "https://variety.com/2021/music/news/eurovision-maneskin-talk-drug-accusations-cocaine-1234981251/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210525182548/https://variety.com/2021/music/news/eurovision-maneskin-talk-drug-accusations-cocaine-1234981251/", "a_id": "Q57415344-7"}
