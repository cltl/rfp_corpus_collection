Jan (Strach), the director, came up with the creative idea and I feel we\u2019ve managed to realise it in the best way possible. I hope fans enjoy the video as it was so much fun to make!\u201d\nDirector Jan Strach added:\n\u201cTo reference a bunch of iconic movies in a funny way was a big challenge, but we pulled it off thanks to Benny\u2019s superb acting and sense of fun. He was able to pay tribute to those movies in such a respectful and fun way.\u201d\nBenny Cristo filming the video for 'omaga' Pavla Hartmanov\u00e1\nFor omaga, Cristo collaborated with producer Filip Vl\u010dek, who says of the song:\n\u201cOur collaboration took Benny into new territory vocally, but I think the challenge really paid off. The style suits him well.\u201d\nAbout Benny Cristo\nBenny\u2019s roots span from the Czech Republic all the way to Angola (his mother and father\u2019s respective birthplaces), and it\u2019s his ability to fuse a range of global genres that \u010cesk\u00e1 televize (\u010cT) believe could give Cristo the edge at the Eurovision Song Contest.\nLast year Benny won the Czech Republic\u2019s national selection show ESCZ with his track Kemama, pushing Elis Mraz & \u010cis T into second place. After the cancellation of the 2020 Contest, Benny Cristo was one of the first artists to receive a no-strings invitation from their home broadcaster to return with a new entry the following year.\nA man of many talents, Ben da Silva Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o is incredibly popular in his home country, packing out Prague\u2019s O2 arena with 15,000 fans to celebrate his first ten years on the music scene. He hopes to repeat this massive party in 2022 when circumstances allow.\nCzech Republic at the Eurovision Song Contest\nThe Czech Republic\u2019s first trip to the Eurovision Song Contest came about in 2007 with thrash metal band Kab\u00e1t, but their song, and the following three Czech entries, failed to qualify for the Grand Final. It wasn\u2019t until 2016 when Gabriela Gun\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 performed her ballad I Stand that the Czechs finally qualified for the Saturday night showcase!\nThe Czech Republic's fortunes have improved in recent years with great results for Lake Malawi (2019) and Mikolas Josef (2018) who finished in 11th and 6th place respectively. A feat all the more impressive from Mikolas when you consider he managed to seriously injure himself while practicing his acrobatics during rehearsal week.", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/story/premiere-benny-cristos-video-for-omaga", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210216175826/https://eurovision.tv/story/premiere-benny-cristos-video-for-omaga", "a_id": "Q11068745-14"}
