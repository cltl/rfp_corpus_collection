On their debut, Brainstorm finished in 3rd place with the song \u201cMy Star\u201d. Latvia won the contest for the first and only time in 2002, with Marie N\u2019s \u201cI Wanna\u201d. Latvia only participated in 2002 thanks to the withdrawal of Portugal from the contest, as Latvia\u2019s poor result in 2001 had relegated them from the 2002 contest. Latvia struggled in to the contest after 2002, failing to qualify for the final for six years between 2009 and 2014. In 2015 and 2016 Latvia has finished 6th and 15th in the final respectively.\nShare this: Share\nTwitter\nFacebook", "original_url": "https://eurovoix.com/2020/02/08/latvia-samanta-tina-to-eurovision-2020/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200226234302/https://eurovoix.com/2020/02/08/latvia-samanta-tina-to-eurovision-2020/", "a_id": "Q13217375-2"}
