The Ukrainian broadcaster will be hosting Vidbir; a one-evening affair in which they\u2019ll be inviting TV viewers to tune in and select Ukraine\u2019s song for the 66th Eurovision Song Contest in Turin.\nAfter taking a break for a year in 2021, when the 2020 Vidbir winners Go_A finally got to represent their country at Eurovision after the Contest\u2019s cancellation the year before, the pre-selection format makes a welcome return on Saturday night. The first edition of Vidbir in 2016 resulted in a win for Jamala with her song 1944, and given how well that went for Ukraine, with 1944 going on to win the Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm that May, the contest has stayed firmly put. Since those impressive beginnings, Vidbir has seen victories from huge acts such as M\u00e9lovin, Maruv and our Shum-trilling friends Go_A.\nFor Vidbir 2022, we have 8 songs in contention to follow-up Ukraine\u2019s respectable 5th-place finish in Rotterdam, and nab that ticket to Turin. Masha Efrosinina will be hosting the show from the main stage, with Timur Miroshnychenko on green-room hosting duties.\n\ud83d\udcfa TUNE IN: Vidbir 2022 will begin at 17:30 CET on UA: PERSHYI on Saturday 12 February. It will also be globally accessible via the broadcaster\u2019s specially set-up live stream on YouTube.\nVoting\nThe result will be determined via SMS voting from the Ukrainian public, and also a professional jury (comprised of Eurovision 2016 winner Jamala, Ukraine\u2019s participant in Eurovision 2006 Tina Karol, and member of the Managing Board of UA: PBC in charge of TV, Yaroslav Lodygin). Once everyone has had their say, Ukraine will have its entry to the Eurovision Song Contest in May.\nThe 8 artists and songs competing in Vidbir 2022\nCloudless NTU\nCloudless \u2013 All be Alright\nThe sound of Cloudless \u2013 a band who have been around for half a decade now \u2013 can normally be rooted in electronica, but they have been known to veer from that path occasionally, in the pursuit of artistic inspiration. One such noteworthy release was the conceptual pop-rock album Mayak, which they put out in 2019, and which featured themes of existential discovery, and overcoming problems.\nTheir song is about acknowledging the imperfections of the world yet believing in the best. The band sings that despite any troubles \u2013 be they internal or external \u2013 everything will be fine; the main thing is to believe in and work first of all on oneself.\n\ud83c\udfb6 Listen: Cloudless \u2013 All Be Alright\nMichael Soul NTU\nMichael Soul \u2013 Demons\nA graduate of both The X Factor and The Voice in Ukraine, it\u2019s fair to say that Michael\u2019s passion for music is huge. And he\u2019s got the back catalogue of albums and singles to prove it! His style combines pop, soul and r&b, though recently he\u2019s been showcasing a more experimental side.\nThis is a song about Michael\u2019s own personal story of being in the darkness. The idea is that if you replace the word 'demons\u2019 with another, like 'people\u2019, then listeners can derive their own meaning from the song.\n\ud83c\udfb6 Listen: Michael Soul \u2013 Demons\nOur Atlantic NTU\nOur Atlantic \u2013 \u041c\u043e\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432 (My Love)\nOur Atlantic is a Ukrainian indie-pop band from Uman town, currently based in Kyiv. The history of the band dates back to 2017. While studying at Uman Music College, the band members began to write together, forming their signature style: Ukrainian-language indie-pop with a touch of disco, funk and soul, inspired by Ukrainian 'mustachioed\u2019 funk of the '70s and '80s.\nThe song is a reflection on the topic of abuse; anyone can become a victim of abuse and it is a sad phenomenon that has no nationality. The musicians are hoping that this theme will resonate with viewers, whether in Ukraine or all over the world.\n\ud83c\udfb6 Listen: Our Atlantic \u2013 \u041c\u043e\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432 (My Love)\nBarleben NTU\nBarleben \u2013 Hear My Words\nBarleben debuted as a solo artist back in 2018, and along with building up an impressive repertoire of releases in the time since, he\u2019s also honed his skills as a performer by taking to the stage at various concert venues, including Leopoliss Jazz, Freedom Hall and Jazz Club Domicile in Dortmund, Germany.\nHis song seeks to remind listeners that in times of fear, hatred, tension and aggression, we need to fall back on love, fill our souls with it and recall what it is like to love ourselves, others, our cause and our country.\n\ud83c\udfb6 Listen: Barleben \u2013 Hear My Words\nRoxolana NTU\nRoxolana \u2013 Girlzzzz\nA former contestant on The Voice of Ukraine, last year Roxolana created an art project called Ukraine Is, featuring contemporary pop music combined with the lyrics of renowned Ukrainian poets.\nHer song is all about finding your inner self \u2013 being brave, becoming free from social pressure and labels, simply living your best life.\n\ud83c\udfb6 Listen: Roxolana \u2013 Girlzzzz\nKalush Orchestra NTU\nKalush Orchestra \u2013 Stefania\nA hip-hop band with a fondness for folk, Kalush Orchestra is made up of rapper Oleh Psiuk, multi-skilled musician Ihor Didenchuk, beatboxing bagpipes player Vitalii Duzhyk, solo instrumentalist Tymofii Muzychuk, and rapper, DJ and dancer Danyil Chernov.\nThe song is a tribute to Oleh\u2019s mother, which she will only be hearing for the very first time when she tunes in to Vidbir!\n\ud83c\udfb6 Listen: Kalush Orchestra \u2013 Stefania\nWellman NTU\nWellboy \u2013 Nozzy Bossy\nJust last year, Wellboy graduated from the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts, and celebrated by releasing his debut single.
