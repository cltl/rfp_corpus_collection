Enter Flo Rida\u2026\nillRoots.com: First off thank you for the interview, its definitely a good look.\nFlo Rida: It\u2019s all good, I appreciate you having me.\nillRoots.com: So what can we expect out of the new Flo Rida album?\nFlo Rida: I mean the name of the album is called \u201cMail on Sunday\u201d. I\u2019m a fan of Jimi Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, my sisters they sung in a gospel group so I just pay attention to music. I paid attention to Biggie, Tupac, Rakim, LL Cool J, Run-DMC, 50 Cent, Ludacris, Outkast\u2026most definitely. I\u2019ve been doing my homework, you can\u2019t be the best if you don\u2019t do your studies. I mean on this album I\u2019ve got Rick Ross, Plies, Lil\u2019 Wayne, Trey Songz, I looking for like an R&B chick to get on this album. I got T-Pain you know he\u2019s one of the hottest dudes out. You know every time I approach music I try to come from the left field but do something everyone can understand. I mean if you look and see I have Jimi Hendrix on my arm and he was a dude that was very special to music.\nillRoots.com: Yeah, I\u2019m a huge fan of Jimi.\nFlo Rida: You know he played the guitar with his left hand. I don\u2019t play any instruments. When I was in elementary school I played the drum and the guitar but I stopped playing and everything. This \u201cMail on Sunday\u201d album is just a spin off of the first single I had called \u201cBirthday\u201d. You know it was like I don\u2019t want cake on my birthday I want cake every day. So that\u2019s basically saying whatever\u2019s your pride possession take advantage of it you know because you might not be as fortunate as others to live to see another day. So you know, Flo Rida, I represent Florida..305\u2026Dade County. Flo Rida ,the name, is who I am when I rap to a beat you know I always try to come with a different flow on every beat that\u2019s very catchy and melodic because of my background. So that\u2019s what Flo-Rida\u2019s all about and that \u201cMail on Sunday\u201d is definitely bound to be a classic album.\nFlo Rida - Birthday [Remix] (Ft. Rick Ross & Brisco)\nillRoots.com: Ten years down the road what do you want your audience to get out of this album?\nFlo Rida: I mean most definitely I\u2019m an artist that grew up through the struggle [I\u2019ve] seen people get murdered, drug dealers, and all that stuff. But what I try to do is come from a universal stand point when I\u2019m making music and not just a local view point. You know I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to live in [Las] Vegas for like 2 years, Cali[fornia] for like 3 years. So I\u2019ve got the west coast thing and I know a lot about that, but that being said on this album I talk about the happiest of times to the sad times, to the lovable times. You know those times when you just loving your girl, and you know past relationships, and its basically just an everyday life album. I try to put something on there where its like the best party you ever had or the worst time you ever had so you might want to grab a tissue or something like that.\nillRoots.com: President of Any Nation which one and why?\nFlo Rida: That\u2019s a hard task, but hey all I know is the USA so I couldn\u2019t go anywhere else.\nillRoots.com: Whats your opinion on the mixtape game?\nFlo Rida: I think it\u2019s the greatest idea alive because you get a chance to see what the artist is doing and when you go and buy their album what they might have a chance to cop. So I\u2019m always supplying people with album quality material for the mixtapes so they will know that with the album comes this same quality of material. So I think that\u2019s a great idea.\nFlo Rida - Low (Ft. T-Pain)\nillRoots.com: One artist that is alive that you would want to work with in the future?\nFlo Rida: I would love to do something with Macy Gray.\nillRoots.com: Yea I\u2019m definitely feeling her voice. Other than that what\u2019s your opinion on the RIAA?\nFlo Rida: I really just feel as a hip-hop artist we should be able to do what we want to do, they just try to pinpoint us for everything because its such a major thing that\u2019s going on.\nillRoots.com: Oh yeah, they do their job- just not as good sometimes, by targeting the wrong people if you will.\nFlo Rida: Right, Right.\nillRoots.com: Thanks to Busy and Flo Rida for setting this up, as well as everybody over at Atlantic Records for giving this guy the push that he deserves.
