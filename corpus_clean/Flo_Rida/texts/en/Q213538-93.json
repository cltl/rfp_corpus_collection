{"title": "WELCOME TO THE ALL-NEW auspOp", "text": "WELCOME TO THE ALL-NEW auspOp\nBienvenue. Selamat Datang. \u062a\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0628. Willkommen. \u6b61\u8fce. Bienvenida. \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1. Welcome.\nTo say the relaunch of your beloved Australian pop site has been a long time coming is an understatement of the highest order. But we hope you agree that it\u2019s been worth the wait.\nWe\u2019ve wheeled out all the bells and whistles (including a hot new logo, plus mobile and tablet editions) to deliver a massive step forward in terms of presentation, usability, connectivity and your overall visitor experience.\nAnd every one of our almost 13,000 stories from the past seven years has come along for the ride.\nSo here\u2019s what\u2019s new;\nYou now have a range of fabulous new options within each of our stories. While yes, you can still leave a comment, you can now tick a box so you\u2019ll receive follow-up comments. Besides that, you can also change the font size of the page and you even have the option to print it, all right there in the story.\nPlus, you can now link through to a host of your favourite socials; be it Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, Pinterest, email and more! We want to help you keep connected.\nThe tag cloud has disappeared, replaced with a drop-down menu teeming with a swag of artists you\u2019ll discover on-site. Find your favourite and it\u2019ll link through to all stories we\u2019ve published featuring them! There\u2019s another drop-down menu below that so you can explore our archives.\nAnd there\u2019s also a handy search bar up top on the right (available via the drop down menu or in landscape mode on mobile/tablet editions).\nMOBILE/TABLET VERSIONS\nIf you\u2019ve clicked on via your mobile or tablet for the first time, gosh, haven\u2019t you noticed a difference!? It\u2019s one area where we feel we\u2019ve let you, our devoted readers, down over the past few years. While technology\u2019s been moving forward and more and more people are visiting in the mobile sphere, we\u2019ve been treading water.\nSo brilliantly, we\u2019re thrilled to announce (and reveal) that instead of those bland ol\u2019 eight posts, one on top of each other, you now have a delightful new experience that gives you everything you love about the new desktop version in a handy pocket-sized edition (that said, your pockets would have to be pretty enormous to carry a tablet in them).\nIt\u2019s all there\u2026 drop-down menus, fancy-pants animations, the chance to comment, share with your myriad socials and much more. So get exploring!\nDROP DOWN MENUS\nYes, it\u2019s a proper website! And you can now choose the information you\u2019re most interested in, without having to fluff your way clumsily through our gargantuan history. Giveaways, interviews, album reviews and more\u2026 whatever takes your fancy, all are easily accessible via our menus.\nFEATURED ARTISTS\nUnderneath the slider images, you\u2019ll discover three feature artists. We\u2019ll be changing those over on a regular basis to shine a spotlight on artists we think deserve their time in the sun or that have something big coming up. Simply click on the photo to be taken to all stories relating to that artist.\nTHE PURGE\nWho doesn\u2019t love something hot to wake up to twice a week? Your Midweek and Saturday News Wraps will exist in the same time continuum they always have (now at 7am on both Wednesdays and Saturdays), but they\u2019re now known as \u2018The Purge\u2019; your twice-weekly purge of pop. Find the latest editions in the \u2018News\u2019 drop down menu.\nCHART WATCH\nNo change to your beloved Chart Watch. We\u2019ll still be getting the official ARIA chart information live to you every Saturday at 6pm. You can access all the latest Chart Watch stories from the \u2018News\u2019 drop down menu.\nNEW RELEASE SCHEDULE\nWhy wait \u2018til Thursdays to get your hit of the latest new release schedule information? The first option under the \u2018New Releases\u2019 menu will take you to our new new release schedule page. We\u2019ll be updating the release information as soon as it becomes available to us, so no matter what day of the week, you\u2019ll always be up-to-date with what\u2019s coming and when.\nauspOp DIARY\nSundays won\u2019t be the same without our regular \u2018auspOp Diary\u2019 segment. But that\u2019s certainly no bad thing, when all the information is now right there at your fingertips, not just for the forthcoming week, but as far as the tour schedule stretches out!\nIn what\u2019s potentially the biggest change to our site, the new auspOp Diary takes the form of a calendar. The shows are there, so too the addresses of the venues, their websites and a handy Google map to show you where you need to go!\nYou\u2019ll also discover links on each entry so you can magically and seamlessly upload the gig information straight to your Google or iCalendar! How\u2019s that for swish!?\nGET TO KNOW\nNew feature alert! Located underneath the Interview banner is a new auspOp feature called \u2018Get To Know\u2019. Discover a range of new and upcoming Aussie and international artists via this new feature as we ask them eleven simple questions in an effort to get to know them a little better. You\u2019ll also discover links to their most important socials.\nNaturally, we welcome your feedback and suggestions on the new-look auspOp and would love for you to become more involved going forward. So don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch via our new \u2018Contact\u2019 page at the bottom of the site.\nWe\u2019d like to thank the team at Universal Music for taking a chance on the new-look site with a lil\u2019 advertising love.\nOne person we really do need to thank for the new site is our incredible web developer Luke, whose patience, expertise, talent, keen eye for detail and dedication have truly made the new site what it is today. You should hire him for your next job.\nAnd thanks to you for your patience and your incredible support throughout the past seven years. And here\u2019s to the next lot with our new-look site.\nAustralia's first stop for pop music! #auspOp", "original_url": "https://www.auspop.com.au/2015/02/welcome-to-the-all-new-auspop/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170101231600/https://www.auspop.com.au/2015/02/welcome-to-the-all-new-auspop/", "a_id": "Q213538-93"}
