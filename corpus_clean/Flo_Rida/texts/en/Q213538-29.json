Tell us a little bit about the track and the concept behind it?\nFlo Rida: It\u2019s a real fun party track. It\u2019s about going out to the club, feeling good, knowing that you\u2019re fly and basically having a good time with your people. It\u2019s just an all round fun song.\nTWU: The video looks really fun. Was it just as fun to make as it looks?\nFlo Rida: OMG the video shoot was a blast. It\u2019s actually my favorite video shoot so far. There was so much positive energy. It was a hell lot of fun to make, definitely my favorite video to date.\nTWU: You teamed up with super-producer David Guetta for this song. What was it like working with him?\nFlo Rida: It\u2019s amazing working with David. He\u2019s one of the most talented guys out there and he\u2019s such a cool person too.\nTWU: You\u2019ve worked with a couple of UK artists (X-Factor winner Alexandra Burke and R&B singer Nathan). Are you a fan of UK music and if so are there any other UK artists you\u2019d like to work with?\nFlo Rida: I love the UK scene. It\u2019s fresh and there\u2019s so much talent out here. I\u2019m a huge fan of Taio Cruz. I\u2019m really liking what he\u2019s doing at the moment. I\u2019d love to do something with him.\nTWU: You\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with some amazing artists - Rick Ross, Wil-I-Am, Ne-Yo, Timbaland, Nelly Furtado etc \u2013 is there anyone you haven\u2019t worked with yet, that you\u2019d really like to?\nFlo Rida: Yeah, loads. I would love to do something with Beyonce. I\u2019ve been on tour with her, which was such an amazing experience. She\u2019s such a talented artist it\u2019s crazy. We haven\u2019t worked on a track together though, so I\u2019d love to do something in the studio with her. I\u2019d also like to do something with Katy Perry. I really like her sound and style.\nTWU: You featured on Lady Gaga\u2019s \u2018The Fame\u2019 album. So what\u2019s your take on the whole Gaga phenomenon?\nFlo Rida: I think she\u2019s incredible. Her creativity, her hustle, she\u2019s really doing her thing. She\u2019s a real artist. You have to give props to someone who puts so much into their craft. And no-one\u2019s doing it on such a level that Gaga is doing it. I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for her.\nTWU: You\u2019ve got a new album \u2018The Only One\u2019 coming out soon. Tell us a bit about the project and what can we expect to here?\nFlo Rida: I\u2019m really excited about this new album. I\u2019ve got some exciting stuff that I\u2019m looking forward to showcasing. There\u2019s the \u2018Club Can\u2019t Handle Me\u2019 with David Guetta which is out already. I\u2019ve got a song with Lil Wayne called \u2018Fresh I stay\u2019 so keep your ears out for that one. I always aim to take it to that next level, so I\u2019m really excited about this project. The LP should be out later this year.\nSource\nCheck out our pictures from Flo Rida's latest video...", "original_url": "http://www.taletela.com/news/2491/flo-rida-talks-collaborations-and-new-album", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20100822015844/http://www.taletela.com:80/news/2491/flo-rida-talks-collaborations-and-new-album", "a_id": "Q213538-29"}
