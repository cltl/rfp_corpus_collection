The seven-day record for most downloads was incidentally set last week, when Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent\u2019s \u201cCrack a Bottle\u201d was purchased 418,000 times. Flo Rida made sure that record was short lived.\n\u201cRight Round\u201d is the first single off Flo\u2019s second album R.O.O.T.S., due out April 7th. As Coolfer points out, if those 636,000 single downloads are the equivalent of roughly 63,600 copies in album sales, then Flo Rida would have sold enough this week to place eighth on this week\u2019s albums chart, ahead of the resurgent Viva La Vida.\nOf course, Flo Rida\u2019s \u201cRight Round\u201d came with a built-in hook that almost guaranteed its success, using a sample of \u201980s new wavers Dead Or Alive\u2019s \u201cYou Spin Me Round (Like a Record),\u201d a song that was popular in its own era but had a late-\u201990s resurgence thanks to The Wedding Singer. Rihanna similarly has constructed a whole oeuvre of turning new wave and \u201980s samples into Top 40 gold: \u201cDon\u2019t Stop The Music\u201d borrows from Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cWanna Be Startin\u2019 Something,\u201d \u201cSOS\u201d borrows from Soft Cell\u2019s \u201cTainted Love\u201d and Rihanna\u2019s \u201cShut Up and Drive\u201d is a fuzzed-out version of New Order\u2019s \u201cBlue Monday.\u201d Similarly, Kid Rock fused Warren Zevon\u2019s \u201cWerewolves of London\u201d and Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d to form \u201cAll Summer Long,\u201d one of the biggest hits of 2008. Consumers evidently are continually willing to shell out money for decades-old hits being reappropriated by contemporary artists, as the success of Flo Rida\u2019s \u201cRight Round\u201d well demonstrates.", "original_url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/02/18/flo-ridas-right-round-shatters-digital-singles-record-with-a-little-help-from-an-80s-hook/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20090219143631/http://www.rollingstone.com//rockdaily//index.php//2009//02//18//flo-ridas-right-round-shatters-digital-singles-record-with-a-little-help-from-an-80s-hook//", "a_id": "Q213538-0"}
