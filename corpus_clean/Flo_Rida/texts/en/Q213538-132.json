{"title": "Why Does No One Care About Flo Rida?", "text": "Why Does No One Care About Flo Rida?\nAmong rap fans and rap critics alike, Flo Rida, one of the most unfortunately catchy rappers of this century, is conspicuously insignificant. Much like will.i.am before him, and MC Hammer before them both, Flo Rida is just the latest in a lineage of dance rap superstars who we\u2019d rather never happened. Rappers and critics thus agree: The proliferation of ringtone rap and Soulja Boy\u2019s \u201cCrank That\u201d in 2007 set the genre back a decade. Every hit Flo Rida single since the hook-driven, T-Pain-assisted \u201cLow\u201d has spelled hip-hop\u2019s death by cynical, lucrative pop crossover.\nSeveral other superstars of the moment suffer such phenomenal disregard: Pitbull comes quickest to mind. Put aside whatever qualms with Pitbull\u2019s songwriting; he\u2019s a rapper nonetheless. Insomuch as Flo Rida is discount Twista (rapping over Nelly-destined beats), it\u2019s strange that we can\u2019t quite regard Flo Rida and Twista as practitioners of the same craft. There\u2019s the shame of it, perhaps; hearing Flo Rida deploy his tongue-twisters so shamelessly in the service of pop and teen-bopping is rather like eavesdropping on a snitch\u2019s sworn confession. Just think: After a couple clutch collaborations with Drake and Nicki Minaj, we take Soulja Boy more seriously than we regard Flo Rida. Chart-topping singles and digital purchasing records be damned.\nWhile Flo Rida's album sales are as depressing as any post-Chingy rapper, his singles chart reliably, and he's so indisputably definitive of pop's cannibalization of hip-hop\u2014yet it\u2019s not like Flo Rida doesn\u2019t rap, or only kinda sorta raps. He\u2019s no less dexterous than Chief Keef\u200b. He sings no more or less frequently than Drake. His music is no less bass-driven than any other legit rap hits of the past five years. Kanye West jacks Nina Simone vocals and auto-croons over the beat. Flo Rida jacks Nina Simone vocals and auto-croons over the beat. Flo Rida and Kanye West are cousins, if not twins.\nWhy does no one give a shit about Flo Rida?\nThe easy complaint is that Flo Rida\u2019s music isn\u2019t substantive nor challenging nor authentic, nor is it quite black. Flo Rida makes a universal sort of dance music that\u2019s rather immune to lyrics and language; not that that couldn\u2019t be said, to some degree, about most drill anthems or Wiz Khalifa\u2019s stoner raps. Since his smash debut with \u201cLow\u201d in 2007, Flo Rida has worked with top-notch hip-hop producers Timbaland, J.R. Rotem, and the Inkredibles, as well as pop hitmakers Dr. Luke, StarGate; he\u2019s laid tracks with Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, DJ Khaled, and T-Pain; yet Flo Rida\u2019s only ever thrived as dance pop.\nPitbull, another spawn of Miami's South Beach club ethos, isn\u2019t as discounted and ridiculed as Flo Rida, but still, he gets minimal respect from the likes of anyone reading or writing for this website. (I now summon staff writer Angel Diaz for the defense.) Pitbull is Cuban, and he\u2019s not quite corny, having launched via Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz\u2019s fourth album, Kings of Crunk, in 2002. Naturally, he\u2019s ingratiated among the U.S.\u2019s top-shelf R&B; stars, at least. And, inevitably, Ke$ha.\nJust as MC Hammer\u2019s legit Oakland rep was trumped and suffocated by his proliferation of pastel vests and harem pants, Flo Rida can\u2019t quite trump his association with Ke$ha and his addiction to shirtlessness. Flo Rida is a Bacardi commercial. Meanwhile, Puffy is a Ciroc commercial. A difference of price and persuasion, if not quality. I admit that \u201cRight Round\u201d is a cheap, tremendous ditty.", "original_url": "https://www.complex.com/music/2014/09/why-dont-we-care-about-flo-rida", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140905065238/http://www.complex.com:80/music/2014/09/why-dont-we-care-about-flo-rida?", "a_id": "Q213538-132"}
