{"title": "The lowdown on Flo", "text": "The lowdown on Flo\nWe always like to know what local rapper Flo Rida is up to. As it turns out, a lot, per usual. The 31-year-old, with hits like Low, is busy around town performing his duo with Akon called Who Dat Girl as well as songs from his new album, Only One Flo. We chatted:\nYou were born in Carol City. What do you love about Miami?\nI love that we have different cultures down here. Miami is fun in the sun. It's what inspires my music.\nLast fall, your third album, ``Only One Flo Part 1,'' was released. When is Part 2 coming out?\nThis spring -- it's gonna be called Only One Rider.\nRecently you launched your own record label, International Music Group. What made you decide to do that?\nI've always wanted to bless some other artists, and I felt it was time to do it. I have Git Fresh signed on.\nYou grew up in the projects in Carol City with a single mom and seven sisters. What words of encouragement do you have for kids who have dreams of following in your footsteps?\nIt's all about dreaming. No pain, no gain. You have to put God first. The bad times aren't going to last forever. I started a charity called Big Dreams for Kids to help those less fortunate.\nWhat's your favorite song to perform?\nI love Club Can't Handle Me. The fans really get into it and have a good time with the song.\nWhat are your future plans?\nI want to get into acting and do some movies. I also want to get more involved in charity work. I really believe the more you give, the more you receive.\n-- ANNIE VASQUEZ\nanniecvazquez@yahoo.com", "original_url": "http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/02/05/2051672/the-lowdown-on-flo.html", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20111228005014/http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/02/05/2051672/the-lowdown-on-flo.html", "a_id": "Q213538-27"}
