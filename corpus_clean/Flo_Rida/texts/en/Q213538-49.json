Last year saw the rise and success of her Jeremih single, \u201cSomebody,\u201d which was followed in short order by a Max Martin single (\u201cAround the World\u201d) and a U.S. tour opening for Epic artists Fifth Harmony. Last month, she hopped on a scorching Ti\u00ebsto and Oliver Heldens track, \u201cThe Right Song,\u201d and today \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 she\u2019s back with a new single of her own.\n\u201cRollercoaster\u201d is, sadly, a disappointingly paint-by-numbers Flo Rida duet, though La Rose\u2019s always spot-on vocals lift it slightly above the dregs of its outdated, EDM-lite styling.
