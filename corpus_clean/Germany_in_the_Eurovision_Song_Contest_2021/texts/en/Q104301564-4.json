It consists chiefly of successive live televised performances of songs by artists (the \"Acts\") entered by the Participating Broadcasters to represent their countries (the \"Contestants\") one after the other between which short sequences are interspersed (the \"Postcards\").\nEach song which competes in the ESC shall be selected through a national selection to be organized by each Participating Broadcaster. The national selection is organized under the sole responsibility of the Participating Broadcaster in question.\nThe Acts are performed during the Shows in front of a live audience and the Shows are presented on stage, in both English and French, by the international presenters.\nThe outcome of the ESC is decided by the votes cast by the National Audiences and by National Juries appointed in the countries of the Participating Broadcasters.\nDuring the televoting window and the time necessary to calculate the results, there shall be so-called \"interval acts\" produced by the Host Broadcaster (the \"Interval Acts\").\nContestants having sung in the Shows shall after their performances join in the so-called \"Green Room\" to assist to the announcement of the results.\nNational commentary by commentators appointed by each of the Participating Broadcasters is added to the international version of the Shows for broadcast in their respective countries.\n2.2 Presentation of the acts\n2.2.1 Performances\n(i) Performances in the shows\nThe allocation of the countries to the two Semi-Finals and the position of appearance of the Host Broadcaster in the Final shall be decided by means of draws organized by the Host Broadcaster.\nThe stage performance shall be identical in all second Dress Rehearsals and during the live shows.\n(ii) Backing tracks only\nContestants and Artists shall perform the songs live on stage, accompanied by a recorded backing-track only (without live instruments).
