Both juries have evaluated all submitted artists, as well as the publically submitted songs.\nOf his selection, Ben said: \u201cWhen I got the news that I had been accepted by the juries, I was totally overwhelmed. Taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest for Germany was a dream come true for me. This is where I made my breakthrough as a professional singer. I think we have the perfect song for the Eurovision Song Contest, and I will give everything I have for Germany.\u201d\nAbout Ben\nBen Dolic was born on 4 May 1997 in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia.

He sings with an amazing degree of confidence and at the same time effortlessness.\u201d\nBen Dolic NDR\nThomas Schreiber, Head of Entertainment at ARD, also weighed in on Ben's selection: \u201cBen Dolic is an exceptional talent.
