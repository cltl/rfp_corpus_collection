Can They Conquer the World?\nROME \u2014 When the rock group Maneskin won this year\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest, it was little known outside Italy. Then the competition catapulted the band in front of 180 million viewers, and propelled their winning song \u201cZitti e Buoni,\u201d or \u201cShut Up and Behave,\u201d into Spotify\u2019s global top 10, a first for an Italian band.\nAs of Wednesday, the song had been streamed on Spotify more than 100 million times. With more nearly 18 million listeners in the last month, Maneskin was performing better on the streaming service in the same period than The Foo Fighters or the Kings of Leon.\nEurovision acts typically disappear from the spotlight as soon as the competition wraps, yet Maneskin\u2019s members are hoping to build upon their existing fame here and newly won international interest to become a rare long-term Eurovision success story.\nA post-curtain controversy that dogged the group last month has only increased the band\u2019s notoriety. On the night of the Eurovision victory, rumors spread on social media after a clip from the broadcast went viral, showing the lead singer, Damiano David, hunched over a table backstage. At a news conference later that evening, a Swedish journalist asked if David had been sniffing cocaine on live TV, and the singer denied any wrongdoing.", "original_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/arts/music/maneskin-eurovision.html", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616140111/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/arts/music/maneskin-eurovision.html", "a_id": "Q106859392-6"}
