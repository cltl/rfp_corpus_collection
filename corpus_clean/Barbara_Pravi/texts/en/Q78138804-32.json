Imagine with me.\" Because it reflects reality \u2013 life is not always easy and fun \u2013 but yet has a strong hopeful message at the end: imagining together a brighter future!\nAnd I also love singing it because it\u2019s a mellow moment of the song that contrasts with the rest of the track, and it finishes with a high note that I really like to reach!\nHow and when did you start with music?\nI started singing when I was very young as my mother used to play all these CDs in Italian so I could fall asleep.\nWho are your idols?\nMy idol is Ariana Grande but I also like other music and rap.\nHow would you celebrate a Junior Eurovision victory?\nI would love to celebrate Junior Eurovision victory with all my family and my friends but above all, I would like to dedicate a victory to my late grandfather.\nHow do you 'Move The World'?\nI try to move the world by doing good deeds with UNICEF and the GOOD PLANET foundation. I think any of us can do this by doing little things.\nThis or That\nThis or That - Valentina from France EBU\nPlaylist", "original_url": "https://junioreurovision.tv/participant/valentina-2020", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201031071140/https://junioreurovision.tv/participant/valentina-2020", "a_id": "Q78138804-32"}
