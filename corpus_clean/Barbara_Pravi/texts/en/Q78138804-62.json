One thing we love about Eurovision is the mix of languages \u2013 English, Spanish, Russian, we love hearing different kinds of music.\nBarbara Pravi\nSince writing Bim Bam Toi for Carla in 2019 and J\u2019imagine for Valentina in 2020, singer-songwriter Barbara Pravi has had a truly banner year in 2021.\n\ud83d\udcfa Watch: Barbara Pravi \u2013 Voil\u00e0\nFollowing a resounding win at the French national final, Barbara took her timeless chanson Voil\u00e0 to a second place finish at Eurovision in May, giving her country its highest placing since 1991.\nFollowing her success in Rotterdam, Barbara released her debut full-length album, On N\u2019enferme Pas Les Oiseaux, in August. The album, whose title translates as \u2018You Don\u2019t Lock Up Birds\u2019, has had a significant impact in the charts in Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France. Barbara\u2019s star continues to rise, and she has tour dates scheduled around Europe through 2022.\nPress Conference with the Hosts and Guest Acts, La Seine Musicale, 18 December 2021 Andres Putting/EBU\nHaving been responsible for Valentina\u2019s success, as well as her own, Barbara was asked whether she had considered singing or writing any of her entries in English or another language:\nI think, the language is the base of a culture, so it wasn\u2019t a question for me \u2013 so if people are opening their hearts at the biggest song contest of all, then it helps to sing in the language of your heart.\nOn what more France could do to win the Eurovision Song Contest, having finished as runner-up this year, Barbara felt philosophical:\nIf we knew what would win Eurovision, we would choose it and we would win. You need a good song \u2013 but what is a good song? You have to smile and have fun, but it also needs to be serious. For the rest you have to pray.\n\ud83d\ude4f\nMake sure to follow the official Junior Eurovision Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook channels for exclusive behind-the-scenes content from Paris.", "original_url": "https://junioreurovision.tv/story/ofenbach-valentina-barbara-pravi", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211219133555/https://junioreurovision.tv/story/ofenbach-valentina-barbara-pravi", "a_id": "Q78138804-62"}
