San Marino have just announced that Senhit will team up with a star-studded songwriting team for their Eurovision Song Contest 2021 entry. The song is called Adrenalina. The official music video, which premiered just now, features global super star Flo Rida. Is this the surprise of the year?\nSenhit and San Marino: A golden combination?\nAdrenalina had been making rounds as the rumoured title for San Marino for a while. What we however did not know and could not have anticipated is the fact that the song has been written by a team including Joy & Linn\u00c3\u00a9a Deb, as well as Thomas Stengaard and Suzi P. Involved in production and featuring as a rapper in the video is Flo Rida.\nFlo Rida is one of the best-selling artists in his home country, the USA. He has sold over 100 million records. The Carol City rapper has some major hits to his name, such as Whistle, Right Round and Hangover. It will not be his first encounter with Eurovision people, having previously recorded songs with both Jessica Mauboy and Slovakian duo TWiiNS.\nWhether Flo Rida will be on stage in Rotterdam is not clear yet. Team San Marino have stated:\nFlo Rida has been part of the production and is featured in the music video, but it\u2019s yet to be decided if he will take part on stage in Rotterdam. The rap part will either way remain. Team San Marino on Flo Rida\u2019s involvement\nFor Senhit, Adrenalina is her third Eurovision single. After previously representing San Marino in 2011 with the ballad Stand By, she made a return in 2020 with Freaky! \u2013 which she couldn\u2019t actually perform on stage due to the cancellation of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. The Bologna based singer has been releasing Eurovision covers to prepare us for her next Eurovision adventure in previous months, making sure the fandom always kept an eye on the microstate.\nA Deb effort\nBehind Adrenalina, we see a Swedish-American songwriting team. Leading the pack, aside from Flo Rida, are two very familiar Eurovision faces: Joy & Linn\u00c3\u00a9a Deb. Linn\u00c3\u00a9a Deb has been responsible for four Eurovision entries so far, with Heroes by M\u00c3\u00a5ns Zelmerl\u00c3\u00b6w as their greatest success. Joy Deb also collaborated on that 2015 Eurovision winner. Other Eurovision entries written by the Debs include You by Robin Stjernberg and Saara Aalto\u2018s Monsters.\nAlso on the list of songwriters are 2020 Melodifestivalen entrant Suzi P, her manager Kenny Silverdique and Swedish composer Jimmy \u201cJoker\u201d Th\u00c3\u00b6rnfeldt. The latter will be having his second Eurovision entry for the year, as he also is part of the team that composed El Diablo for Elena Tsagrinou. The song, which has sparked controversy in its home country, will represent Cyprus in Rotterdam. Also coming from the El Diablo team is former Eurovision winning composer Thomas Stengaard. The last two names in the songwriting team are Malou Ruotsalainen and Chanel Tukia. Senhit also receives credit as part of the songwriting team.\nSuccess in the making?\nEver since rumours arose that Adrenalina could end up being the Sammarinese entry for Eurovision 2021, the betting odds have gone pretty crazy. Coming from odds of 300/1 or 500/1, San Marino are now down to 20/1 with some agencies. It is a clear indication that people believe in the chances of San Marino, even though the betting market is fresh and only a couple of bets will make a huge difference.\nJust last week, San Marino postponed their song release by a week. Soon after, Senhit confirmed she was still in the studio working on her entry for Rotterdam, which now turns out to be Adrenalina. The official Eurovision channel released a (two-minute) teaser for the Sammarinese entry on Sunday afternoon after rumours took Twitter by storm.\nUp to now, San Marino have never managed to make the top ten at the end of the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2021. Serhat achieved their best result in 2019 with Say Na Na Na, which did score a top ten with televoters, but failed to impress the juries. Can Senhit and Adrenalina give San Marino their best result ever?\nWhat do you think about San Marino\u2019s entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, \u201cAdrenalina\u201d by Senhit?
