No drug use took place in the green room and we consider the matter closed.\u201d\nThe EBU added that it was \u201calarmed that inaccurate speculation leading to fake news has overshadowed the spirit and the outcome of the event and unfairly affected the band\u201d.\nDuring a press conference following M\u00e5neskin\u2019s win, David denied using drugs and said he bent over because another band member had broken a glass at their feet. The EBU subsequently said band members had asked that David be drug tested to refute the speculation.\nWhile Italy celebrated its first win since 1990, the UK suffered a brutal defeat as James Newman and his song Embers came last as the only entry to score nul points from both the jury and the public vote.\nNewman thanked fans on Monday and said he wanted to \u201cfocus on the positives of this amazing experience\u201d of the competition, which saw more than 7 million UK viewers tune in to watch the Saturday night finale.\n\u201cThe thing about writing songs is that there is no guarantee that a song you think will connect with people will connect with an audience,\u201d he wrote on social media. \u201cThe times when it doesn\u2019t play out how you hoped it might, teach you how to pick yourself up and be stronger.\u201d\nEarlier, the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, dismissed the idea that the UK\u2019s nul points was a \u201cpost-Brexit snub\u201d. She told LBC there was a \u201cfundamental problem\u201d with the way entrants are currently chosen and suggested the BBC shouldn\u2019t choose future artists.\n\u201cI think we need to have more competition to get the right entrant, I think they need to be more tested with the public,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m here today at LBC responding to questions from listeners, that\u2019s the kind of testing that we need our song contest entrant to go through. So maybe it should be LBC that\u2019s running it, not the BBC.\u201d", "original_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/24/eurovision-maneskin-lead-singer-cleared-of-taking-drugs-at-final", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210524190645/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/24/eurovision-maneskin-lead-singer-cleared-of-taking-drugs-at-final", "a_id": "Q57415344-4"}
