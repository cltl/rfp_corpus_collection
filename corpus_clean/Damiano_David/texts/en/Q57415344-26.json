Here, we\u2019re starting by talking about a little-known fact surrounding their victory performance.\nUnknown to most, the group sang two different versions of their hit song, \u201cZitti e Buoni\u201d (meaning \u201cShut Up and Be Quiet\u201d) at the show. After being asked to clean up their lyrics to comply with Eurovision\u2019s no-expletive rule, they changed \u201cNon sa di che cazzo parla,\u201d meaning \u201cThey don\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about,\u201d to \u201cNon sa di che cosa parla,\u201d meaning, \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d for their first performance.\n\u201cWe had to perform without the bad words because they asked us to be polite,\u201d lead singer and breakout heartthrob, Damiano David, explains with a smile. \u201cBut when we won, I said, \u2018Okay, who gives a fuck, we won! Let\u2019s say the dirty words!\u2019\u201d\nIf M\u00e5neskin \u2013 pronounced \u201cMorn-e-skin\u201d meaning \u201cmoonlight\u201d in Danish and paying tribute to bass player Victoria De Angelis\u2019s dual heritage \u2013 needs introducing, they are the band who stormed the legendary song contest in Rotterdam last month, sealing Italy\u2019s first win since 1990, and, in the process, arguably putting the contest back on the map as a credibly cool thing to take part in.", "original_url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/miss-vogue/article/maneskin-interview", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210603105046/https://www.vogue.co.uk/miss-vogue/article/maneskin-interview", "a_id": "Q57415344-26"}
