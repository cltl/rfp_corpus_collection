She presented a proposal to the Andorran president Xavier Espot and RTVA director Xavier Mujal back in 2019 and has been awaiting a response.\nWell now they\u2019ve answered and, as she tells me on the Wiwibloggs podcast, which you can listen to below, \u201cit\u2019s only good news.\u201d\nLong story short: She says the country plans to return to Eurovision in 2022, after the Covid-19 pandemic has hopefully subsided.\nAndorra will likely return to Eurovision 2022\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been having conversations on and off, but since there\u2019s been so much going on with the Covid, I felt like I was paused for a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cAs you know I\u2019ve been quite pushy. I had a lovely, lovely meeting just a few days ago. And I must say it\u2019s only good news.\u201d\n\u201cThe government is very positive. There is sort of a verbal green light, but not for 2021. I\u2019m also agreeing with that 100%. We think it\u2019s too soon. Here we\u2019re still fighting with the Covid\u2026and we\u2019re just too afraid of spending all this work and money and hard work on something that maybe won\u2019t be able to happen in 2021.\u201d\nSo the idea is to return to Eurovision in 2022.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new government and they do listen to the country. For many years I felt I was knocking my hands into a big pillow and nothing would happen. But I really feel heard, and they really want to do something for the music scene and the artists of Andorra\u2026.We just need to get over this huge crisis we have.\u201d\n\u201cThere is still nothing officially signed \u2014 this is all verbal. It\u2019s been at meetings. It\u2019s not my job to say we\u2019re going officially \u2014 that would have to come from the TV station or the government. But I think it\u2019s positive we have this debate going now. Verbally, it is sort of confirmed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m super happy. I\u2019m super thrilled. I feel like I\u2019ve finally been heard.\u201d\nAs Susanne told us in an interview over the summer, she wants to secure a commitment to participate for three years. While she\u2019s open to singing for the country at Eurovision again, she\u2019s more interested in becoming the Head of Delegation first \u2014 to steer the country back into the contest and to showcase other artists in the country.\nContest winner\nFinally, it\u2019s congratulations to Eurovision fan Martin in Denmark! We ran an Instagram contest asking for fans to say why they wanted to see Andorra back in the contest. I chose a comment at random and it was his. He\u2019ll receive an autographed \u201cGet a Life\u201d CD from Susanne herself. Here\u2019s what he wrote:\n\u201cI want Andorra to return to the contest to hopefully experience their culture and see what they\u2019ll be able to bring into the competition a decade after they withdrew. Besides, if Andorra joins the competition, there might be a possibility that other microstates and small countries either debut or return.\u201d\nAre you excited to hear these developments?
