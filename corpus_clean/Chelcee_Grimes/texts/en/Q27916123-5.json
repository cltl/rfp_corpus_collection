Penning tracks for all our pop faves including Dua Lipa, Kylie and The Saturdays, she\u2019s now stepping up to the mic herself and we couldn\u2019t be happier. Dropping her debut track \u201cJust Like That\u201d, it\u2019s an R&B-tinged banger that we\u2019re gonna be bopping along to all weekend. And with an album on the horizon too, she\u2019s guaranteed to find her place among pop royalty where she belongs, so we grabbed a quick chat to find out just how she\u2019s getting prepared.\nHey Chelcee, how are you? I\u2019m great, thank you! Just very, very excited about my single being released!! Going back to the beginning \u2013 when did you first get involved with music? I got into music quite late actually, I was 15/16. I only really got into it because I took music GCSE because I thought it would be easier than History or Geography and found out I really enjoyed writing songs and creating\u2026 My music teacher said I had talent so I just pursued it for a little and things started to happen. What kind of styles were you into? I grew up on R&B/Pop music. So Jennifer Lopez, Xtina, Alicia Keys, Beyonce, But as I got a little older I Loved Gwen Stefani, Avril Lavigne, P!nk, Lady GaGa\u2026 All the big pop ballsy girls! I was never really into boybands\u2026 Have you always wanted to do something musical? No, not really. From the age of seven, I wanted to be a footballer. I played for Liverpool ladies for six years. I play for Fulham now so I\u2019m living my dream doing both. You\u2019ve penned tracks for Kylie, Dua, and loads more of our faves. How did you first get involved with that? Well, it\u2019s not the most glamorous story. The truth is, I got dropped (from the same label who signed me back four years later may I add\u2026) But that\u2019s the truth! I got dropped, had to make money and knew I could write, So I started from the bottom \u2013 literally \u2013 in my bedroom and started writing for people to sing my songs. At first it was hard because I wanted to be the one singing them, on the stage, but eventually it made me learn more about myself, gain more respect in the industry and help me figure out what album I really wanted to make and what nobody else was really doing\u2026 Do you approach writing songs for other people differently to when you write them for yourself? No, not really. It\u2019s just that when your writing for somebody else, they usually give you a brief to work with so you know what kind of vibe your going for. Also it\u2019s their song so I will always be like \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in your life\u201d and I try to word it in a cool way\u2026 However, when I get in the studio, I just try to not box myself in and just go with whatever is in my head at that time\u2026 and I don\u2019t have to ask anybody anything. It\u2019s just all about what I want, sometimes that\u2019s scarier because it\u2019s all on you.. But sometimes that\u2019s the most wonderful thing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a risk but that\u2019s what life\u2019s about right??\u201d", "original_url": "https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2018/06/08/new-noise-chelcee-grimes/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201019152630/https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2018/06/08/new-noise-chelcee-grimes/", "a_id": "Q27916123-5"}
