{"title": "Chelcee Grimes: game of two halves", "text": "Chelcee Grimes: game of two halves\nLike a lot of people from Liverpool, Chelcee Grimes has two overriding passions in her life: football and music. Where she stands out from the majority of Scousers is that she has been able to forge successful careers in both.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t one of those kids who was singing from the age of three. That wasn\u2019t me. I was playing football.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m playing football, making music and getting to play shows. I\u2019m literally living the dream,\u201d says the bubbly 25 year old, sipping a glass of ros\u00e9 in a pub in West London, close to Fulham football club, where she plays for the women\u2019s team. So far this season, she\u2019s played nine times and scored six goals, including three in the FA Cup. Her achievements as a songwriter are even more impressive, penning hits for Olly Murs, Jonas Blue, Kesha, Louisa Johnson, Kylie Minogue, The Saturdays, Tom Walker and 2017\u2019s most streamed female artist, Dua Lipa, whose smash self-titled debut featured three songs co-written with Grimes.\n\u201cThe past few years have been a bit of a crazy roller-coaster. Right now, I\u2019m just taking every day as it comes,\u201d she reflects, citing writing sessions in Los Angeles with Calvin Harris and Lady Gaga producer RedOne as two recent standout moments that have required her to pinch herself to check she wasn\u2019t dreaming. \u201cAs a young kid I used to have a poster of Lady Gaga on my bedroom wall, so to be in the studio with the guy who helped write all those songs was just surreal.\u201d\nMore recently, Grimes has been in the studio working on Dua Lipa\u2019s highly anticipated second album. She\u2019s also been busy working on her own music, the first fruits of which were released earlier this year in the form of debut single Just Like That and catchy follow-up I Need A Night Out.\n\u201cMy friends are like: \u2018Are you mad? Why are you putting your own music out? You get to go to all the cool parties? You get to know all these famous people. You make good money. But you can still get the tube and no one knows you.\u2019 But I miss performing when I\u2019m locked in a studio. I\u2019ve actually got a vitamin deficiency over the last three years because I\u2019ve not seen the sun. I\u2019m locked away in a dark cavey room making records for other people, which is amazing. I love it and know I\u2019m very fortunate but I do miss putting my own music out.\u201d\nIn the same way that her current life revolves around football and music, the origins of Grimes\u2019s songwriting career also has close ties with the beautiful game. \u201cI wasn\u2019t one of those kids who was singing from the age of three. That wasn\u2019t me. I was playing football. And I was one of the lads and if you look at my younger pictures, I\u2019m always in footie kits,\u201d recalls the passionate Liverpool fan, who started playing for the club\u2019s women\u2019s team when she was 10 and has also had spells at Everton and Tranmere Rovers Centre of Excellence.\nWhen it came to deciding her GCSE options, PE and sports science were obvious choices. Grimes says she only picked music as her third subject because she thought it would be easy. Early on her teacher recognised her talent for composing catchy melodies and when she was 16 a Liverpool teammate entered her into a talent competition run by a local radio station. She missed the audition cut-off date, but got an email from one of the judges inviting her to compete in the finals anyway.\nThe judge who contacted her was professional footballer Ryan Babel \u2013 then playing for Liverpool \u2013 and Grimes won the competition by performing her self-written song. \u201cFor the next six months I got to hang out with Ryan Babel, go to all the Liverpool games and work in his home studio with an engineer. That was my first taste of being in the studio and from then on I got the bug,\u201d she remembers.\nDeciding to concentrate on music full time, the singer-songwriter reluctantly gave up football when she was 17, just before she could turn professional, and signed a record deal with Sony Music imprint RCA two years later.\n\u201cIt was kind of like: \u2018Here\u2019s a bunch of money. Stay in Liverpool and make an album.\u2019 I was young and naive and thought: Cool. I guess this is how it works,\u201d she wistfully recalls. It wasn\u2019t to be, however, and the singer was dropped before she even released a note of music. \u201cThe boss who signed me got the sack and it\u2019s like football: when a new boss comes in, he wants to go and get his own players and I was just caught in that landslide.\u201d\nHaving spent all her advance, panic set in. \u201cIt was a case of: \u2018Shit. What am I going to do now?\u2019 I was banging on doors and no one wanted to give me a chance because I\u2019d already been signed once.\u201d\nDetermined not to give up, the singer moved to London and called upon one of the many life lessons that her sporting background had instilled in her. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve played football from such a young age, I have the mentality of you can be three-nil down at half time and come back and win. Getting dropped at 20 was a kick in the teeth, but it just felt like I\u2019d conceded a goal. Not that the full-time whistle had blown. I knew that I could come back and it ultimately gave me more fire.\u201d\nLooking back on this period, Grimes recalls being \u201cabsolutely skint and miserable, doing the rounds in basement and bedroom studios, just trying to get my name out there\u201d. The hard work gradually paid off and she soon found herself in Copenhagen working with Danish producer Cutfather. It was her first session writing for another artist and she co-wrote a song called Million Miles, which Kylie Minogue picked up for her 2014 album Kiss Me Once.\n\u201cI thought: \u2018This is easy.\u2019 But really it was beginners\u2019 luck. I soon found out it doesn\u2019t usually happen that way, but it got me excited about music again,\u201d she says with a hearty laugh.\nA short while later, when watching former teammates Izzy Christensen, Fara Williams and Nikita Parris play for England in the Women\u2019s World Cup, the singer decided to rekindle her football career. \u201cI was lying on the couch, skint, eating Doritos, thinking: \u2018What am I doing? I\u2019ve made the wrong choice here.\u2019\u201d\nIn response, she fired off an email to several clubs \u201cthinking I might get a grassroots team\u201d and surprised herself by landing a contract with Tottenham. When they got promoted, Grimes dropped down a league to join Fulham FC Foundation Ladies, where she could continue to train and play without having to give up her burgeoning music career.\n\u201cMusic is so tough mentally, football has been a little saviour for me,\u201d she reflects. \u201cBeing a creative, I live on my songs. OK, I\u2019ve had a bit of success, but if I don\u2019t write another hit for 10 years I\u2019ll be skint again one day, so it\u2019s a lot of pressure on yourself and there\u2019s a lot of competition. When I go out to play football for 90 minutes, I\u2019m not thinking of anything else apart from get the ball in the net. It\u2019s dead easy and simple. I always say to young people looking to get into music, try and have something running alongside it that just takes you away from it for a bit. Because it can really get you down. It\u2019s very full on. It\u2019s intense and you are constantly battling with your own demons and thinking you\u2019re not good enough.\u201d\nAsked what fuels her determination to succeed, Grimes playfully avoids the question and jokes about \u201cbeing a bit crazy\u201d before casually and unexpectedly revealing that her father died from a heart attack when she was young. It\u2019s something she says she doesn\u2019t talk about often and is the one part of our conversation where her chatty, hyper-friendly and approachable exterior drops to reveal a different side of the songwriter.\n\u201cNo one wakes up and goes: \u2018I\u2019m going to be a music star.\u2019 They usually come from a place of having pressure on them or something that spurs them on,\u201d she hesitantly reflects. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what my mum\u2019s gone through and it\u2019s been hard. She was a widow under the age of 30. I felt like she deserved more and used to say to her: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, mum. I\u2019ll make it so you can retire early.\u2019 I was six years old and I guess that was a massive thing. It was tough, but that was just the card I was dealt.\u201d\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of her success is the ability to treat her family. Last Christmas she paid for her mum, stepfather and little sister to go to Disneyland Paris. \u201cI don\u2019t live a mad flash life, but as long as I\u2019ve got enough to do stuff for my family and give a little bit back to my mum, it\u2019s boss. Sometimes when I can\u2019t think of a lyric I\u2019m like: \u2018Do it for them.\u2019\u201d\nA song she wrote about her dad called 11:11 has, meanwhile, become one of the musician\u2019s biggest hits to date after it was recorded by South Korean superstar Taeyeon. To date, the ballad, sung in Korean, has been viewed 50 million times on YouTube. It\u2019s one of the few songs that Grimes has written for other artists that she plans to include on her upcoming debut album, due next year.\n\u201cA lot of the other stuff that I\u2019m bringing out is super-organic and the lyrics are just for me. I feel like no one else could sing them,\u201d she says, promising a record that will make you \u201claugh, cry, jump around and you can also have on in the morning when you\u2019re hungover\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to do things that I actually love and then when the time is right and something connects, we\u2019ll be laughing. Right now, I\u2019m just taking every day as it comes, accept who I am and try to translate into music that I am not just one thing. In this generation girls can be a lot more than just one thing. There\u2019s really no barriers at the minute. It feels like everyone can just be themselves and it\u2019s a lot more accepting.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to know that if you\u2019re good enough, you\u2019re a nice person and keep your head down you will get your time. You\u2019ve just got to make sure that you take it when it happens.\u201d\nChelcee Grimes on\u2026\nChoosing between football and music\nFootball is a great thing that I love to do. Unfortunately, I\u2019m a woman and it doesn\u2019t pay as well as the men\u2019s game. If I was a man, maybe I\u2019d say football. But music has been my life for the past six years and it\u2019s my whole adulthood and adolescence all in one. It\u2019s been the thing that I\u2019ve been driving for, so I think right now I\u2019d say music. But ask me next week and maybe my answer would change. I can never decide. It\u2019s too close.\nGetting inspiration from Lady Gaga\nI learned how to write music from the first Lady Gaga album. I remember just listening to it religiously. In the era I grew up in, the early 2000s, you didn\u2019t really see any pop stars playing instruments. It was that era of girls oiling themselves and rolling around on a beach. And then this weird looking woman came out with a disco stick who could play classical piano and then go into a dance break. It was an eye opener for me. She also stood for something in her interviews and was intelligent. She\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve queued to see. I still love her now, just in another way. I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for her and she was a big influence.\nDeciding which songs to keep for herself and which ones to give to other artists\nI write a lot of songs for people and some I\u2019m really connected to, but you are in a position where there might be an artist who\u2019s got millions of followers and they can PR the shit out of it and make you a lot more money. Or do you keep it for yourself and maybe it won\u2019t be seen as the biggest thing because you haven\u2019t got that name? You\u2019re constantly in a catch 22 situation.\nHer future goals\nIn five years hopefully I\u2019ll still be playing [football] as a good level and enjoying that and also still writing songs for other people and not really having a plan \u2013 just seeing how I feel. I want to be spontaneous and travel and make music and if I can sell a few tickets to my own shows along the way that would be brilliant as well.", "original_url": "https://www.bigissuenorth.com/features/2018/12/chelcee-grimes-game-two-halves/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200814134922/https://www.bigissuenorth.com/features/2018/12/chelcee-grimes-game-two-halves/", "a_id": "Q27916123-2"}
