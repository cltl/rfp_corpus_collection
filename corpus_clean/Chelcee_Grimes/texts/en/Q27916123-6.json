She spoke so much about loyalty and kicked off that I messaged someone openly from the show and all the time she was messaging someone behind my back.\"\nShe continued \"She went behind my back and made a dog move on me. That girl isn't insecure. She knows what she is doing. \"I really liked her and she went behind my back and got with an old friend of mine. If anything that makes me insecure.\n\"I had to block them both. I just thought it was a liberty. The truth is she made a dog move, she went behind my back and she waited until filming had finished to finish things.\"\nChelcee, who is a Fulham Ladies footballer, recently stated that she identifies as bisexual in an interview with Gay Times. \"I mean, people would say that I guess. But I say all the time it\u2019s about what\u2019s upstairs, not downstairs.\n\" If I can have a conversation with someone, and I\u2019m getting along with them, and they\u2019re making me laugh, and I find them attractive \u2013 it\u2019s not about body parts, it\u2019s about the person. Definitely.\"\nShe continued: \"I\u2019ve got a lot of gay friends, and I always hear people say, \u2018Oh you don\u2019t look gay\u2019. And especially because I play football a lot, people are like, \u2018Oh how many lesbians are on your team\u2019, and it\u2019s just like, \u2018Ugh, why does it matter?\u2019\n\"There\u2019s a lot of straight people, there\u2019s a lot of gay people, there\u2019s a lot of people in between. I just want us to get to a place where it\u2019s okay however anyone identifies, you know?\"", "original_url": "https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/megan-barton-hanson-new-girlfriend-19579849", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190909035343/https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/megan-barton-hanson-new-girlfriend-19579849", "a_id": "Q27916123-6"}
