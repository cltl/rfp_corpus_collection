Where did the inspiration for the song come from?\nWell, I was actually sexting with someone I was dating, and that\u2019s basically where it came from [Laughs] I jumped in the booth when I was working on a different song, and then I was just trying to warm up and started beat-boxing to the producer down the microphone, and he was like, \u2018Woah, what is that?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Nothing, I\u2019m literally just warming up\u2019, and he was like, \u2018Let me record you really quick\u2019, and then I ran in the room and started making up joke lyrics to it, and we wrote it in like 10 minutes. I just thought it was a funny song that I\u2019d maybe send to someone as a personal joke, but the record label were like, \u2018We love this, it\u2019s gonna be your first single\u2019.\nThe video is really cool, too. What\u2019s the message there?\nWell, because the song is so tongue-in-cheek and sexual, I didn\u2019t want to be all oiled up and gyrating on someone, so I sent the song to a few directors and Charlotte Rutherford, who came up with the concept, said \u2018What if it\u2019s all old people getting it on, and it\u2019s actually nothing to do with you\u2019, and I thought \u2018Oh my god, this is genius\u2019. I grew up on old school Eminem and Avril Lavigne and super early 2000s music, and it reminded me of that nostalgia, so I was like, \u2018Perfect, let\u2019s go for that\u2019.\n\ufeff\nAm I correct in saying you identify as bisexual?\nI mean, people would say that I guess. But I say all the time it\u2019s about what\u2019s upstairs, not downstairs. If I can have a conversation with someone, and I\u2019m getting along with them, and they\u2019re making me laugh, and I find them attractive \u2013 it\u2019s not about body parts, it\u2019s about the person. Definitely.\nHow important do you think it is that the LGBTQ community has out and proud artists that they can look up to?\nIt\u2019s so important, it\u2019s ridiculously important. I mean, I\u2019m so proud to be in a generation now where there are so many out and proud people around us, and it\u2019s so accepted, and it\u2019s becoming more and more okay. Because at the end of the day, to me, whoever you love, it\u2019s fine, you know? It is the way it is. So yeah, I think the more the merrier!\nYou have a platform to share your voice now \u2013 are there any stereotypes or misconceptions about the LGBTQ community you want to challenge with your music?\nAll the time! I\u2019ve got a lot of gay friends, and I always hear people say, \u2018Oh you don\u2019t look gay\u2019. And especially because I play football a lot, people are like, \u2018Oh how many lesbians are on your team\u2019, and it\u2019s just like, \u2018Ugh, why does it matter?\u2019 There\u2019s a lot of straight people, there\u2019s a lot of gay people, there\u2019s a lot of people in between. I just want us to get to a place where it\u2019s okay however anyone identifies, you know? So hopefully I can help or at least speak up on those issues when I get the chance to.\nThe first professional song you wrote was for Kylie, right? She\u2019s a huge gay icon\u2026\nIt was. I\u2019d just been dropped from my first record deal, and I was trying to find another route back in, and I knew I could write songs by that point, I knew I was quite capable of doing it. So I was in Copenhagen, I was writing with Cutfather, who already had a connection with Kylie because he\u2019d worked with her before, and it was my first time away from home, my first writing trip, and the first thing that came out of my mouth was, \u2018I feel like I\u2019m a million miles away\u2019. Again, it happened really fast, we laid it down and they were like, \u2018Kylie\u2019s looking for some songs, maybe this could work for her?\u2019, so they emailed her and within the same night she\u2019d replied back saying, \u2018I love it, I wanna cut the song\u2019, and I was like, \u2018No way! Is it really that easy?\u2019 Unfortunately it\u2019s not that easy most of the time, but it was a great start. I love Kylie, she\u2019s an icon like you said, so it was a huge honour.\nWho are some of your biggest musical icons or influences?\nGrowing up, it was always strong pop women. So people like Gwen Stefani, Pink, and Lady Gaga. She was huge for me. When I went to see Gaga supporting The Pussycat Dolls \u2013 because Nicole Scherzinger was my first ever girl crush \u2013 I was like, \u2018What, who, when and why!?\u2019 Because she\u2019d do a dance break, then jump on the piano, and she was just insane. Every song was great. I used to tweet her and RedOne when I was like 18 years old and say, \u2018I really want to work with you guys!\u2019 On my last trip to LA, I got to work with RedOne on my album which was insane. I was like, \u2018Dude, I used to tweet you all the time!\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, we\u2019re here now, so let\u2019s kill it\u2019. That was really a defining moment for me.\nCan you tell us anything about your song with RedOne?\nWell, I can\u2019t say too much, but it\u2019s a great song. I love it. It\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from him \u2013 a big pop song.\nWhat can we expect from your debut album? Are you still working on it?\nYeah, I\u2019m still working on it, but I\u2019ve been unintentionally writing this record for the past three or four years. Obviously I\u2019ve been writing for other people, but I\u2019ve also been saving stuff for myself knowing I would eventually get the green light to just focus on my record. The album\u2019s literally a day in the life of most young people now, from the age of 18 through to 25. I\u2019ve been in love, I\u2019ve broken hearts, I\u2019ve had my heart broken, I\u2019ve partied, I\u2019ve been hungover \u2013 it\u2019s just got everything I\u2019ve experienced over the past four years on there. Expect a lot \u2013 you\u2019ll cry, you\u2019ll laugh, everything.\nWomen\u2019s football has come a long way over the years, but there\u2019s still a sense that it\u2019s not taken as seriously as men\u2019s football. Do you struggle with that?\nYeah, it\u2019s definitely\u2026 I always try and look at the positives, though. From me playing at the age of 10 to me playing now, it\u2019s grown massively, so we can always say, \u2018Oh it\u2019s not as big as it should be\u2019, but it is getting bigger, and that\u2019s all I can hope for. I\u2019m seeing so many young girls getting more and more involved in the sport, which is so exciting to see. Obviously it\u2019s still not pulling in the same crowds as men\u2019s football, but that\u2019s why they\u2019re not paid the same. That comes from advertising and sponsors and television. For me, obviously I\u2019m not pulling in the same crowds as Beyonc\u00e9 or someone like that, so I\u2019m not on the same wage, but it\u2019s a progression, you know? The sky\u2019s the limit now, I think, and I try and look at the positives. I\u2019m very, very happy to be a part of the sport, and hopefully I can help it grow in some way.\nIt\u2019s 2018 and we still don\u2019t have an openly LGBTQ Premiership football player. Do you think it\u2019s the time for that?\nI think it\u2019s definitely the time! I mean, the way the world\u2019s been the past few years it\u2019s all been a bit crazy, but we need people to start standing up for what they believe in. That\u2019s definitely something I try and do as much as possible. I\u2019m not afraid of anyone, and I\u2019ll go against the grain as much as possible. Especially with the music I make, people listen to it and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god, no one\u2019s making music like this\u2019, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Well it\u2019s the music I like, so I\u2019m going to make it\u2019. I\u2019m not trying to fit in. What\u2019s the point in doing what everyone else is doing? Of course not everyone has that same mindset, though. It does depend on the crowds you hang around with, and your upbringing. It\u2019s easy for us to sit here and say, \u2018Oh you should just be out now\u2019, but we\u2019re not in everyone\u2019s shoes, and it\u2019s down to everyone as an individual if they want to speak up. But I do think now is the time for anyone who wants to come out. I think they\u2019d be accepted.\nYou mentioned earlier that you were dropped from your label. What did you learn from that experience?\nI was 19 when it happened, and I was dropped after just six months, I didn\u2019t even get to put a song out. So it was like, \u2018Yes! I\u2019ve just been signed! Oh, wait\u2026\u2019 It was literally the worst time of my life, and it happened just before Christmas as well. But looking back, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It made me get my head down and really think about the record I wanted to make. The songs I\u2019m writing now are 150 times better than the songs I was writing at 19. I\u2019ve experienced, I\u2019ve lived, I\u2019ve grown into who I am. I know who I am now, but at 19 I didn\u2019t have a clue. The world works in weird, mysterious ways, but I do believe that everything happens for a reason. This time around, I think what I\u2019m doing differently is I\u2019m just being myself, I\u2019m not trying to be anything I\u2019m not, and I\u2019m so okay with myself. That\u2019s the best thing I could possibly do.\nYou\u2019ve written for so many incredible artists, but what was your best experience?\nI think honestly it has to be RedOne! I know people would expect me to say an artist that\u2019s gone on to sing one of my songs, but for me, having been a 16 year old sat in my bedroom crying when I saw Bad Romance by Lady Gaga on YouTube, that was such a huge moment for me to go in to RedOne\u2019s studio and see Gaga\u2019s records like Just Dance and Poker Face on the wall. I was like, \u2018Dude, that made me want to make music\u2019. I\u2019ve gone from Liverpool in a little two-by-two bedroom to LA with this super producer. It just blows my mind. Also, I got to work with Calvin Harris last year, which was amazing, he just treated me and it was so sick. So it\u2019s definitely a toss up between Calvin and RedOne.\nIf you could collaborate with anyone else in the world, who would it be?\nOh man, there\u2019s so many! I just love Gaga so much. But of course I also love Rihanna, and Pink, and Bruno Mars \u2013 I\u2019m a massive Bruno fan \u2013 there\u2019s so many people. But yeah, if I had to choose one, it\u2019d be Gaga.\nChelcee Grimes\u2019 debut single Just Like That is available to download and stream now.", "original_url": "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/chelcee-grimes-interview-just-like-that/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200812055002/https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/chelcee-grimes-interview-just-like-that/", "a_id": "Q27916123-14"}
