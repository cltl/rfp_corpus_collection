{"title": "Wonderlick - Montaigne", "text": "Wonderlick - Montaigne\nWe\u2019re not talking about the philosopher, though the moniker is indeed a reference to the 16th century essayist. But if Michel de Montaigne is to renaissance philosophy, this Montaigne is to music. Montaigne is the stage and artist name of 18-year-old Sydneysider Jessica Cerro and this is how she lives through music.\nJessica Cerro was a triple j Unearthed High\u2019s finalist in 2012 with the boppy indie pop song \u2018Anyone But Me.\u2019 Late last year Montaigne recorded her first EP with producer Tony Buchen (The Preatures, Andy Bull), the debut single from which, \u2018I\u2019m A Fantastic Wreck\u2019 was released last month and met with astounding praise from some of the world\u2019s most influential music blogs including All Things Go, Indie Shuffle and The 405.\nA circus of sounds is the best way to describe Montaigne\u2019s newest single I\u2019m A Fantastic Wreck, the singer\u2019s second offering from her forthcoming EP Life of Montaigne.\nLayered vocals and plucking guitar ease the listener into the song before a charge of heavy instrumentals and powerful lyrics penetrate the calmness, constructing a sound that perfectly fits the song title.\nKeeping with the theme of the single, its video \u2013 directed by Melbourne based writer and director Guy Franklin (Kimbra) \u2013 is composed of quirky animations juxtaposed with real-life footage shot in Melbourne\u2019s historic Mintaro Homestead, built in 1882.\nLife Of Montaigne is out now.\nMontaigne is currently on tour as the special guest for Megan Washington, after which she will embark on her own headline tour in April.
