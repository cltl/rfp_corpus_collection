(SBS)\nMontaigne and Didirri are the next two artists to participate in \u2018Eurovision \u2013 Australia Decides\u2019 in February 2020.\nSBS and production partner Blink TV today revealed the next two artists who will participate in \u2018Eurovision \u2013 Australia Decides\u2019 in February.\nHosted on the Gold Coast and broadcast live and exclusively on SBS, art pop auteur Montaigne and emerging singer-songwriter Didirri will perform an original song for their chance to represent the country at the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\nThey join four previously announced artists, Aussie icon Vanessa Amorosi, powerhouse entertainer Casey Donovan, rising First Nations artist Mitch Tambo, award-winning singer-songwriter iOTA and four more artists yet to be revealed.\nThese are the six artists announced so far who'll compete for the chance to represent Australia at next year's Eurovision Song Contest.\nMontaigne\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to participate in Eurovision \u2013 Australia Decides for the opportunity to release the part of me that is dramatic and extreme. I manage to do it without a massive international music event as impetus, but on the big stage in Europe in front of millions would be everything the drama queen egomaniac inside me could want, and more. It\u2019s licence to let her out,\u201d says Montaigne.\nAt only 24, the Sydney-based artist has become a major name in Aussie indie music. The past few years have seen her recognised for her work with multiple spots on the Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100, an ARIA award for Best Breakthrough Artist and a nomination for Best Female Artist on her debut album \u2018Glorious Heights\u2019. Her sophomore album \u2018COMPLEX\u2019 was released in August to critical acclaim.\nMontaigne went on to say she\u2019d relish the chance to represent Australia on the world stage. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite get that far in football, so it would be cool to do it in music. It\u2019s like the World Cup for pop.\u201d\nDidirri\n\u201cI have always been interested in writers. Although the world of Eurovision is new to me, from the outside it seems to respect a well-written song above all else. People seem to be free to express their art in whatever way they want,\u201d says Didirri.\nDidirri\u2019s debut EP \u2018Measurements\u2019 has collected over 30 million streams, and led to Didirri playing such renowned festivals as the UK\u2019s The Great Escape and Latitude Festival, Australia\u2019s Splendour In The Grass and Barcelona\u2019s Primavera Sound. In a matter of months, he toured the US and UK twice and shared the stage with well-known acts Vance Joy, Hozier, Tash Sultana, The Temper Trap and more.\n\u201cPersonal experience inspires most of my own writing - all I hope to do is to help people express some part of themselves. I\u2019m also over the moon to be joining the line-up with my friend Montaigne who I respect very much.\u201d\n\u201cMontaigne and Didirri are two of the most intriguing artists in Australia at the moment and they bring with them a strong Triple J fan base highlighting yet again how inclusive and exciting Eurovision \u2013 Australia Decides is. This is the only show in Australia that can bring together such an amazing group of artists performing original music - and with four more artists still to be announced, this is going to be an incredibly difficult decision for Australia to make!\u201d says SBS Commissioning Editor for Entertainment, Josh Martin.\nCreative Director of Eurovision \u2013 Australia Decides Paul Clarke said, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching the careers of Didirri and Montaigne for a long time. They\u2019ve been two of the most exciting Australian songwriters and performers to emerge in recent years, and we\u2019re delighted to have them perform in Eurovision - Australia Decides.\n\u201cThey bring a different energy and audience to the event, and you can feel the brilliant diversity of talent who are gathering. We can promise a terrific show in February - it will be next level! We\u2019re also planning some excellent surprise guests for the Opening Night and Matinee shows, so it\u2019s worth seeing them live on the Gold Coast.\u201d\nIn association with the Queensland Government via Tourism and Events Queensland, the City of Gold Coast, Screen Queensland and new partner Moroccanoil, Eurovision \u2013 Australia Decides will be presented at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre on Friday 7 and Saturday 8 February.
