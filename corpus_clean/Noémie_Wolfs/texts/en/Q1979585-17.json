Fier\u00adce per\u00adforming fema\u00adle artists have con\u00adsist\u00adent\u00adly been ser\u00adving up vocal con\u00adfi\u00addence which we\u2019ve absor\u00adbed and have even been libe\u00adra\u00adted by sin\u00adce music found its pre\u00adfer\u00adred mode of tran\u00adsit over our radio\u2019s, mp3\u2019s and now online strea\u00adming. Des\u00adpi\u00adte this, the gen\u00adder divi\u00adde in the music indus\u00adtry across all regi\u00adons is rough\u00adly 70% male and 30% fema\u00adle. As we find our\u00adsel\u00adves more immer\u00adsed in the pro\u00adgress of fema\u00adle per\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adti\u00adve expres\u00adsi\u00adons, empowe\u00adring women in the music indus\u00adtry is more important than ever before. Noemie Wolfs is an examp\u00adle of such a neces\u00adsi\u00adty. Wolfs, pre\u00advious\u00adly the lead in an other\u00adwi\u00adse all male band sought to be a part of that 30% and con\u00adfi\u00addent\u00adly push her own crea\u00adti\u00adve inte\u00adrests and poten\u00adti\u00adal out into the world. Per\u00adforming for five years under their ico\u00adnic name Hoo\u00adver\u00adpho\u00adnic, Noemie had alrea\u00addy made a name for herself with a dedi\u00adca\u00adted crowd of fans eager to sup\u00adport her tran\u00adsi\u00adti\u00adon to solo performer.\nHaving had the pri\u00advi\u00adle\u00adge of spea\u00adking to Noemie on the\u00adse mat\u00adters and more, we felt the weight of such a decisi\u00adon. With this new found free\u00addom came a chan\u00adce for the young artist to explo\u00adre her own rea\u00adli\u00adty and step away from the con\u00adstruc\u00adted public per\u00adso\u00adna that can some\u00adti\u00admes stick to for\u00admer mem\u00adbers of a band. Reco\u00adgnis\u00aded as one of Bel\u00adgi\u00adum\u00ad\u2019s most prai\u00adsed young voices, she\u2019s released tracks that depict this con\u00adcept; the divi\u00adde bet\u00adween public and pri\u00adva\u00adte, free\u00addom and ent\u00adrap\u00adment. We got the chan\u00adce to dive into this with the crea\u00adti\u00adve power\u00adhouse that is Noemie Wolfs, tal\u00adking evo\u00adlu\u00adti\u00adon, femi\u00adnism, her Bel\u00adgi\u00adan roots and thoughts on envi\u00adron\u00admen\u00adta\u00adlism today.\nSin\u00adce embar\u00adking on your much anti\u00adci\u00adpa\u00adted solo care\u00ader, how do you feel you\u2019\u00adve evol\u00adved, musi\u00adcal\u00adly and per\u00adso\u00adnal\u00adly? Over\u00adall it comes from the best decisi\u00adon I could ever have made, lea\u00adving Hoo\u00adver\u00adpho\u00adnic to start a solo care\u00ader. It was\u00adn\u2019t an easy path, that much is true. But it feels good knowing I left my com\u00adfort zone com\u00adple\u00adte\u00adly, being in full con\u00adtrol of ever\u00adything from music, vide\u00ados, and art\u00adwork. This pro\u00adject is 100 % me and that is the best fee\u00adling that the\u00adre is. With every song, every album I made so far, my self-con\u00adfi\u00addence kept gro\u00adwing and gro\u00adwing and it\u2019s nice to see that my song\u00adwri\u00adting skills con\u00adti\u00adnue to evol\u00adve as well. I know I still have a lot to learn but I\u2019m eager to learn it and I have the pos\u00adsi\u00adbi\u00adli\u00adty to work with the best peop\u00adle in this business. Have you felt sup\u00adpor\u00adted by other women in the indus\u00adtry, or inspi\u00adred by tho\u00adse who have done the same? If so, who are some artists that have inspi\u00adred you the most? Do you have any advice for young women loo\u00adking to get into the music indus\u00adtry? I think women can sup\u00adport each other even more than we alrea\u00addy do. Women all over the world are step\u00adping up for equal rights and equal pay. I could\u00adn\u2019t be hap\u00adpier with this evo\u00adlu\u00adti\u00adon but the\u00adre is still a lot of work to be done. I\u2019m inspi\u00adred by a lot of artists, male and fema\u00adle. From David Bowie to Grace Jones, Roi\u00adsin Mur\u00adphy, and even Tame Impa\u00adla. The\u00adre is so much good stuff out the\u00adre, it\u2019s cra\u00adzy! If I can share one pie\u00adce of advice that always works for me, it is just belie\u00adving in yourself, even if no one else does. If you want to make it in this busi\u00adness you have to work hard, keep your feet on the ground and never stop drea\u00adming or believing! You\u2019\u00adre Bel\u00adgi\u00adan, do you feel your music or per\u00adso\u00adnal style pays homage to your heri\u00adta\u00adge in some way? Or would you like it to? Not real\u00adly. I try to keep my mind and per\u00adspec\u00adti\u00adve as open as pos\u00adsi\u00adble and I don\u2019t want my music and my per\u00adso\u00adnal style to be one thing or ano\u00adt\u00adher. I find inspi\u00adra\u00adti\u00adon in all kinds of things from old Con\u00adgo\u00adle\u00adse music to Eng\u00adlish lite\u00adra\u00adtu\u00adre. May\u00adbe one thing that is kin\u00adda Bel\u00adgi\u00adan is that my favo\u00adri\u00adte fashion brands are Bel\u00adgi\u00adan: Y/\u200bProject from Bel\u00adgi\u00adan desi\u00adgner Glenn Mar\u00adtens, Dries Van Noten en Mai\u00adson Mar\u00adgie\u00adla. Bel\u00adgi\u00adans do fashion better. Are you whe\u00adre you want to be? What do you envi\u00adsi\u00adon for your future as an artist? I have so many dreams and so many goals still to achie\u00adve and I like that fee\u00adling. I like to set the bar real\u00adly high for mys\u00adelf and for my team so that if we achie\u00adve some\u00adthing, it\u2019s a win for ever\u00adyo\u00adne! I see my team as my fami\u00adly: we are all working towards the same goals tog\u00ade\u00adther and we want to reach the best pos\u00adsi\u00adble result. The sky\u2019s the limit!", "original_url": "https://neubau-eyewear.com/de/blog/noemie-wolfs-shes-carved-out-a-space-of-her-own-and-found-her-creative-freedom", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210618150341/https://neubau-eyewear.com/de/blog/noemie-wolfs-shes-carved-out-a-space-of-her-own-and-found-her-creative-freedom", "a_id": "Q1979585-17"}
