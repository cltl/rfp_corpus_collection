{"title": "ESNS Festival", "text": "ESNS Festival\nESNS 2021\nIn March 2015 No\u00e9mie Wolfs announces she\u2019s parting ways with Hooverphonic after five years. Soon after that Universal offers her a record deal. The label is impressed by her voice and demos. Her first ever demo, \u2018Hunt You\u2019, actually ends up as title song of her debut album. Five years later, February 2020, the Belgian releases her second album, the melancholic Lonely Boy\u2019s Paradise. It contains songs about lonely souls and unrequited love, not per se autobiographical, but full of elements out of the lives of people around No\u00e9mie.", "original_url": "https://esns.nl/en/festival/artists/noemie-wolfs/", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20230416102017/https://esns.nl/en/festival/artists/noemie-wolfs/", "a_id": "Q1979585-16"}
