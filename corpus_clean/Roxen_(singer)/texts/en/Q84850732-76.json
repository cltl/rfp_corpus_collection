Former Head of Delegation, Liana Stanciu stated last year that her favorite song was indeed UFO and finished second, but a jury panel decided to go with \u201cAmnesia\u201d for Eurovision.\nNow the song is out, what do you think? Could have been a better option for Romania in 2021 or do you prefer \u201cAmnesia\u201d? Tell us down bellow!\nLast year Romania was represented by Roxen with her song \u201cAmnesia\u201d, she was internally selected for the 2nd time after the cancellation of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2020.
