This year\u2019s Romanian entry will be performed by Roxen, who was set to represent the country in 2020.\nLast March, TVR announced they would invite Roxen back to compete at the 2021 contest. Her entry has been selected by a jury, instead of a national selection like in 2020.\nOnly two days to wait!\nWith Roxen\u2019s entry set to be released this Thursday, it means we only have two days left to wait to hear her next entry for the contest. Last year, \u201cAlcohol You\u201d was selected as her entry via a song selection.\nYesterday, TVR revealed the jurors that were involved in selecting the Romanian entry for 2021. The jury includes former Eurovision representative Lumini\u00c5\u00a3a Anghel, alongside many other leading figures in music and entertainment.\nThe song is currently one of four entries set to be released on Thursday alongside entries from Moldova, The Netherlands and Belgium. Belarus are also reportedly set to announce their artist on Thursday.\nRomania at the Eurovision Song Contest\nRomania first debuted at Eurovision back in 1994 with Dan Bittman, who finished in 21st place with 14 points. After failing to qualify in 1996, the country returned in 1998, finishing 22nd. Since 2002, they have never missed a contest and throughout their history enjoyed good results and qualification rates. However, they are yet to win the contest.\u00c2\nSo far, their best result is 3rd place, which they have achieved twice. The first came in 2005 with Luminita and Sistem in Kyiv and again in 2010 by Ovi and Paula Seling in Oslo. In more recent years, they broke their qualification streak in 2018, when The Humans finished 11th with 107 points in the second semi-final.\u00c2\nIn 2020, Romania\u00c2 internally selected Roxen\u00c2 to represent them at the Eurovision Song Contest. A national final took place to then\u00c2 select \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAlcohol You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as her entry.\u00c2 Despite the cancellation of the contest,\u00c2 TVR decided to send Roxen\u00c2 once again for the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest.\nAre you excited to hear the Romanian entry?
