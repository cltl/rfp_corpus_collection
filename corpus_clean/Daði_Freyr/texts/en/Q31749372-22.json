From the grand final's top 4, the winner will become Iceland\u2019s representative at the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\nIf the organizers of S\u00f6ngvakeppnin wish to do so, they have the option to use a wildcard and add a 5th song to the grand final.\nThe international public will be able to watch both semi-finals and the grand final, as they will also be broadcast online on R\u00daV 1.\nIcelandic versus English\nAll songs in the semi-finals will be sung in Icelandic due to the competition's rules, these state that songs in the semi-finals must be performed in the national language.
