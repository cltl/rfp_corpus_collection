{"title": "Best Songs of 2020", "text": "Best Songs of 2020\nThe best songs of 2020 were created in studios from Seoul to Johannesburg, Puerto Rico to Nashville. They strut, commiserate, titillate and disarm. Some of them are collaborations that showcase premier talents pushing each other to new heights; others are deeply personal projects of introspection and catharsis. Here are the songs we had on repeat in our homes all year long.\nAlso read TIME\u2019s lists of the 10 best fiction books of 2020, 10 best nonfiction books of 2020, 10 best podcasts of 2020 and the 10 best video games of 2020.\n10. \u201cLong Road Home,\u201d Oneohtrix Point Never\nThe strings that kick off \u201cLong Road Home\u201d are so urgent they transport listeners straight into a concert hall. Then they settle into a sparkling song that\u2019s a constant surprise until its final note. The tension of that journey is echoed in the lyrics: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t wanna transform/ Taking the long way home.\u201d Daniel Lopatin, the mastermind behind the sonic experiment that is Oneohtrix Point Never, has said this song is about learning to live in uncertainty. He finds moments of approachability here, thanks in part to vocals contributed by Caroline Polachek and mixed to anonymity. But the operatic confusion, present throughout his ninth studio album Magic Oneohtrix Point Never, is part of the pleasure. He cuts, chops and shifts with manic energy, never resolving into anything less tense than those early strings. Lopatin is also a soundtrack composer, most recently on the acclaimed, chaotic 2019 thriller Uncut Gems, and it\u2019s that sense of veiled storytelling that comes alive during the ride of \u201cLong Road Home.\u201d\u2014Raisa Bruner\n9. \u201cUwrongo,\u201d Prince Kaybee, Shimza, Black Motion, Ami Faku\nPrince Kaybee and Shimza, two of the brightest stars of South Africa\u2019s flourishing house music scene, had a falling out two years ago after the former accused the latter of failing to credit him on songs. Luckily, they reconciled to create this low-burning triumph of exquisitely picked guitars and splashy cymbal work. Their immersive textures are a perfect backdrop for rising Afrosoul singer Ami Faku, who sings of overcoming burdens through an ethereal undulating melody.\u2014Andrew R. Chow\n8. \u201cBack Door,\u201d Stray Kids\nContemporary pop out of Korea is almost impossible to classify today. \u201cBack Door,\u201d from Stray Kids, is a prime example: there\u2019s not a single musical style it doesn\u2019t exuberantly co-opt, in an artful Frankenstein that\u2019s as catchy as it is complex. There are dramatic airhorns, slinky R&B breaks, jazz interludes, a trap chorus, electronic beats that would rile up festival crowds and others more likely to be found in underground clubs. It\u2019s hard not to become enraptured by the song\u2019s sheer bravado\u2014both in its multi-layered production and the brassy energy of the eight performers. Stray Kids, who debuted just three years ago, are the latest act poised to break out in an increasingly globalized and free-wheeling pop industry, one that South Korea in particular has been eagerly pioneering. That \u201cBack Door\u201d starts and ends on a cheeky note in English\u2014\u201dHey, you wanna come in?\u201d\u2014only drives home its willingness to welcome everyone into the fold.\u2014RB\n7. \u201c7 Summers,\u201d Morgan Wallen\nFor many across the world this year, the pandemic erased the best aspects of summer: the cookouts, tailgates, block parties, vacations and family reunions. So it makes sense that one of this summer\u2019s foremost anthems was a morose journal entry of a song that turned its gaze onto some edenic past of lazy, stressless afternoons. For three minutes, you could sit in your room, close your eyes and imagine drifting down a river and sipping on a sixer alongside a friend or romantic interest, Wallen\u2019s watercolor guitars serving as a portal to a sunkissed state of mind. But at the end of each chorus, Wallen breaks the reverie, forcing himself and the listener to come to terms with an anxious present reality. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it make you sad to know,\u201d he asks, \u201cthat was seven summers ago?\u201d\u2014ARC\n6. \u201cThink About Things,\u201d Daoi Freyr\nAt once funky and futuristic, \u201cThink About Things\u201d is the ultimate earworm: a warm, loving slice of electropop, with a slinky synth line, catchy chorus and groovy bass. Released by the Icelandic singer Da\u00f0i Freyr P\u00e9tursson and his group\u2014which consists of his sister, wife and friends\u2014it was initially destined for the stages of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, one of Europe\u2019s kitschiest and most popular TV traditions. But after the annual competition was canceled for the first time in its 65-year history, the song\u2014the supposed frontrunner\u2014took on a life of its own as a viral hit, thanks to a quirky quarantine dance challenge set to the song that spread rapidly across social media. Written for the artist\u2019s infant daughter, its universal message of unconditional love and tender curiosity hits the right notes well beyond the glitzy Eurovision stage.\u2014RB\n5. \u201cGood News,\u201d Mac Miller\n\u201cGood news, good news, that\u2019s all they wanna hear,\u201d rapper Mac Miller complains, resigned but almost content with his self-imposed burden: to document the modern condition and all its uncertainties. The first single released after his death in 2018, the song is a meditation and a lament. \u201cSo tired of being so tired,\u201d he sings, \u201cWhy I gotta build something beautiful just to set it on fire?\u201d Like all of Miller\u2019s work, it sounds deceptively effortless: a simple, guitar-plucked melody gives him a background over which to drape his warm verses. Those lines, too, are a front; as he shifts from unhurried singing to calm rapping, he documents an everyday struggle to stay afloat in the tide of this strange life. Miller was known for wrestling his demons in song. Here, he layers in a wry self-knowledge that rejects easy listening, even as he beckons us to relax into his gentle, timeless musical embrace.\u2014RB\n4. \u201cLittle Nokia,\u201d Bree Runway\nOne of the most arresting breakout stars of 2020 has been Bree Runway, a multi-hyphenate Brit who can rap like Missy, dance like Janet and snarl like Joan Jett. Her debut mixtape, 2000and4Eva, runs the gamut from punk rap to hyperpop to Madonna tributes; she squeezes attitude and enormous hooks into every stretch. The most peculiar of the lot is \u201cLittle Nokia,\u201d a vicious rap-rock hybrid that should serve as a reset for any lingering negative connotations that have stuck to a genre that many have criticized for being artless and brutish. As she sings about an unfaithful, unreliable lover, she makes a mesmerizing turn from bratty to lofty from the verse to the chorus. Behind her, the grainy synthesizers seethe with fury.\u2014ARC\n3. \u201cYo Perreo Sola\u201d remix, Bad Bunny, Ivy Queen and Nesi\n\u201cYo Perreo Sola\u201d has virtually no musical components, but it doesn\u2019t need any: Bad Bunny\u2019s voice is so husky, it fills up all the space above resonant reggaeton drums. Not since \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d has the lack of a bassline sounded so good. Meanwhile, the song\u2019s video\u2014which features the Puerto Rican star in drag\u2014elevates the song into a transgressive anthem, while the remix, which adds two generations of Puerto Rican hip hop in Ivy Queen and Nesi, turns it into an exuberant posse cut for the ages. If packed clubs are part of the world\u2019s future, \u201cYo Perreo Sola\u201d should be a dance floor staple for decades to come.\u2014ARC\n2. \u201cWAP,\u201d Cardi B feat. Megan Thee Stallion\nFew rappers today have the cultural cache of Cardi B, New York\u2019s resident firebrand and hitmaker, and Megan Thee Stallion, Atlanta\u2019s ebullient star. Together on WAP, they released a song that shook up the charts and, with its celebratory, explicit and uproariously creative lyrics, drummed up both controversy and conversation around sexuality and even sexual health. As a track, WAP is simple yet effective: a juicy bassline and looping backing vocal underlay Cardi and Megan trading verses, with barely a break to catch a breath: the momentum is infectious. But more than anything, it\u2019s their shared sense of humor, playfulness and eyebrow-raising delight that make the song one of the year\u2019s surprising joys.\u2014RB\n1. \u201cPeople I\u2019ve Been Sad,\u201d Christine and the Queens\nThere\u2019s a good chance that your favorite artist took a stab at writing a quarantine song this year. That song was probably an anthemic ballad, and it probably attempted to convey loss and alienation before gesturing toward uplift and perseverance. Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber tried their hand (\u201cStuck With U\u201d); so did Luke Combs (\u201cSix Feet Apart\u201d), Ben Gibbard (\u201cLife in Quarantine\u201d), and Bono and Will.i.am (#Sing4Life).\nBut none of those efforts came close to Christine and the Queens\u2019 agonizing, hypnotic \u201cPeople I\u2019ve Been Sad,\u201d which was written by H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier last year as she grieved the death of her mother. Released in February as coronavirus was just dawning on the global horizon, \u201cPeople I\u2019ve Been Sad\u201d serves as proof that the best art usually comes from personal experience rather than attempts at universality. In English and French, Letissier sings about losing people and \u201csolitude folle\u201d (\u201ccrazy loneliness\u201d) over a frigid synth beat, her voice blue but yearning, as if trying to vocally excise her despair.\nAnd whereas many others this year offset their musical misery with some pablum of eventual edification, Letissier instead belts an oddly comforting pledge of mutual destruction. \u201cIf you fall apart, then I\u2019m falling behind you/ You know the feeling/ You know the feeling.\u201d It\u2019s a mantra of acceptance of communal suffering and of making peace with tragedy\u2014and her soaring, open voice makes it nearly impossible not to howl along.\u2014ARC\nGet The Brief.
