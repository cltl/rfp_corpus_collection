The singer, who is signed to PANIK Records will perform the song \u201cEl Diablo\u201d.\nElena Tsagrinou is one of the most talented and glamorous singers in the Greek pop scene. She was born in Athens in 1994 and by the time she was 14-years-old she had already taken part in the talent show Greece Got Talent where she made it all the way to the semi-final. In 2013 she joined the band OtherView but after five successful years with the band, Elena embarked on her solo career. She released her debut single with the symbolic title Pame Ap\u2019 Tin Arxi, meaning \u2018Let\u2019s go from the start\u2019 which was written by Dimitris Kontopoulos and Nikos Moraitis.\nMany other songs followed and Elena\u2019s popularity skyrocketed. Her music videos on YouTube reached millions of views making her one of the best pop singers of her generation in the region and she has garnered tens of thousands of followers on social media along the way. Throughout these years she has performed in several music shows in Greece and Cyprus too. Elena\u2019s talent extends beyond singing as well! She also has a successful career on television as a coach (on TV music show Just The 2 Of Us) and as a presenter (she co-presented The Voice of Greece in 2016 and 2017).\nAt the Eurovision Song Contest in 2021, Elena will be performing a song about falling in love with someone as bad as \u201cEl Diablo\u201d, a song composed and produced by Jimmy Thornfeld, Laurell Barker, Oxa, and Thomas Stengaard. You might already know some of these names from other Eurovision songs like She Got Me, Only Teardrops and You Let Me Walk Alone. The staging will be organised by artistic director Marvin Dietmann, who also is no stranger to the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\u201cEl Diablo\u201d will be released at a later date so you\u2019ll have to hold on tight until then! We hope you are as excited to hear it as we are!", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/story/elena-tsagrinou-will-represent-cyprus-at-eurovision-2021", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201125075052/https://eurovision.tv/story/elena-tsagrinou-will-represent-cyprus-at-eurovision-2021", "a_id": "Q55348650-0"}
