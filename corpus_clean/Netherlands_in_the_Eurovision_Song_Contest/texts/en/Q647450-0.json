Yugoslavia also decided to stay home because of a national holiday. Israel and Greece returned to the contest so the number of participants was 19 again, just as in the previous year. The set in Gothenburg's Scandinavium was very modern and bigger than any venue before. Parts of the set would later be re-used for the Swedish national final Melodifestival in 1987.\nNorway surprised everyone with their victory this year. The entry La Det Swinge\" by the duo Bobbysocks, won after a close race with the German entry, F\u00fcr Alle by the group Wind. Bobbysocks consisted of the singers Elisabeth Andreasson and Hanne Krogh. Elisabeth had already taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1982 for Sweden where she was one half of the group Chips. Hanne Krogh had represented Norway already in 1971, but only came 17th with her song Lycken Er. She would again return to the Eurovision stage in 1991 as part of the Norwegian group Just 4 Fun.", "original_url": "http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301#event_info_301", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080120091711/http://www.eurovision.tv:80/index/main?page=66&event=301", "a_id": "Q647450-0"}
