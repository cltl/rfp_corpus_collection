However the uncertainty created by the spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe \u2013 and the restrictions put in place by the governments of the participating broadcasters and the Dutch authorities - means the EBU has taken the difficult decision that it is impossible to continue with the live event as planned.\nWe are very proud that the Eurovision Song Contest has united audiences every year, without interruption, for the past 64 years and we, like the millions of fans around the world, are extremely saddened that it cannot take place in May.\nThe EBU, NPO, NOS, AVROTROS and the City of Rotterdam will continue a conversation regarding the hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2021.\nWe would ask people to bear with us while we work through the ramifications of this unprecedented decision and patiently await any further news in the coming days and weeks.\nWe would like to pay tribute to all the host broadcaster team in the Netherlands and our 41 Members who have worked so hard on planning this year\u2019s event.\nWe are all as heartbroken as they are that the Eurovision Song Contest will not be able to be staged in May and know that the whole Eurovision family, across the world, will continue to provide love and support for each other at this difficult time.", "original_url": "https://www.ebu.ch/news/2020/03/eurovision-song-contest-2020-cancelled", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200318145455/https://www.ebu.ch/news/2020/03/eurovision-song-contest-2020-cancelled", "a_id": "Q85971923-2"}
