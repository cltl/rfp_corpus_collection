Nothing. All we knew was that Channel One would broadcast an event to determine the artist and song that will represent Russia in Eurovision Song Contest 2021 in Rotterdam.\nTonight's show was the first Russian Selection since 2012, and featured only three songs performed live from Moscow. The show was hosted by Yana Churikova.\nThe voting was 100% up to the Russian public who could only vote once. They voted for Manizha who will go to Eurovision 2021 with the song \"Russkaya Zhenschina\" (\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 / Russian Woman).\nRussia 2021: Manizha \u2013 \"Russkaya Zhenschina\"\nRussian Selection 2021 \u2013 Result\nLittle Big performed the song \"Uno\" that were supposed to go to Eurovision Song Contest last year. The band had previously announced that they would not be up for competition in 2021 as they don't want to compete against their song from 2020.\nOther guests were: Philipp Kirkorov (Russia 1995), Polina Gagarina (Russia 2015) and Dima Bilan (Russia 2006 and 2008).\nManizha\nManizha Dalerovna Sangin (\u041c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0436\u0430 \u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u043d) is 29-year-old from Dushanbe, Tajikistan, currently living in Moscow. She began her professional career under the name Ru.Kola, and had a hit with the song Neglect in 2009.\nThe song \"Russkaya Zhenschina\" is written by Manizha herself along with Ori Avni and Ori Kaplan.\nManizha says:\n\u2013 This is a song about the transformation of a woman\u2019s self-awareness over the past few centuries in Russia. A Russian woman has gone an amazing way from a peasant hut to the right to elect and be elected. From factory workshops to space flights. She has never been afraid to resist stereotypes and take responsibilities.\n\u2013 This is the source of inspiration for the song. By coincidence I wrote it in March 2020 while on tour, but for the first time I perform it a year later.\nRussia 2013: Dina Garipova - \"What If\"\nSince 1994 Russia has participated 22 times in Eurovision Song Contest. They won the contest in 2008 with the song \"Believe\" performed by Dima Bilan.\nRussia 2013: Dina Garipova - \"What If\"\nIn 2017 the Russian singer Yulia Samoylova was denied entry to Ukraine, and therefore Russia decided to boycot Eurovision 2017. She returned for the 2018 contest in Lisbon, but for the first and only time, Russia didn't qualify for the Grand Final.", "original_url": "https://eurovisionworld.com/esc/russia-decided-manizha-to-sing-russkaya-zhenschina-in-eurovision-2021", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210308194748/https://eurovisionworld.com/esc/russia-decided-manizha-to-sing-russkaya-zhenschina-in-eurovision-2021", "a_id": "Q29359663-9"}
