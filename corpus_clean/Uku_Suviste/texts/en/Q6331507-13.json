The great interest of millions of viewers cheering for Contestants and the Contest\u2019s concert programs is the indication that the New Wave has become a highly anticipated annual international music award.\nThe idea to organize a new Contest, unlike any other Contest ever held in Russia and the CIS states, was suggested by composers Igor Krutoy and Raimond Pauls in the early 2002. Such a grand music festival provides an opportunity to discover and recognize new talented young singers.\nOver the years of hosting the Contest, Heads of various states have expressed high appreciation of this international music festival. Every year, on the day of the \u2018New Wave\u2019 Grand Opening, starting from the very first Contest at the Dzintari concert hall, greetings from Presidents of Russia, CIS, Baltic, European and many other countries to the Contest and its Contestants were read.\nMany of the Contestants from different years have become popular artists. Over the years, the Contest has opened many names \u2013 D. Bilan (Russia), S. Lazarev (Russia), E. Butler (Israel), A. Stotskaya (Russia), \u2018Cosmos\u2019 band (Latvia), I. Dubtsova (Russia), I. Busulis (Latvia), T. Karol (Ukraine), P. Gagarina (Russia), N. Gordienko (Moldova), Nyusha (Russia), I. Dorn (Ukraine), S. Sondoro (Indonesia), Niloo (Russia), Roberto Kel Torres (Cuba), A.

During the Contest, over 800 people and several transport trailers with decorations and equipment arrived in Jurmala on behalf of the \u2018New Wave\u2019 Organizing Committee.

The 2004 contestant Vincens from Norway was awarded with a ring from the Smolensk Diamonds at the stage of the Dzintari concert hall.\nAt the \u2018New Wave-2005\u2019, the first prize went to Intars Busulis from Latvia, the winner of the second prize was Tina Karol from Ukraine, and a Russian pop singer Polina Gagarina took the third place.

Four Contestants from previous years took part in the \u2018Eurovision-2006\u2019 in Athens, which confirmed the high level of selection and trainings of our Contestants. Such result is a solid evidence and credential to the quality of the selection committees of the young singers\u2019 countries, as well as to the passion and recognition shared by the multimillion audience of one of the greatest European song Contests. At the \u2018Eurovision\u2019, Eddie Butler performed for Israel, Tina Karol sang for Ukraine, Dima Bilan represented Russia, and the Cosmos represented Latvia.
