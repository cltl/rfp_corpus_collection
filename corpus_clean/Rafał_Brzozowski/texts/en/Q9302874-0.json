Agustin Egurrola was the choreographer and the video was directed by Pascal Pawliszewszki.\nAbout RAFA\u0141\nEurovision fans might recognise Rafa\u0142 Brzozowski as a co-presenter of the 2020 Junior Eurovision Song Contest in Warsaw, Poland. His other TV work includes the popular music show The Name of the Tune and his time as co-host of the Polish version of Wheel of Fortune.\nRAFA\u0141\u2019s music career started with his participation in The Voice (of Poland), releasing his debut single Tak blisko (\u201cSo Close\u201d) shortly after. Riding high in the Polish airplay and sales charts, the entertainer found further success with his albums Tak blisko and M\u00f3j czas (My Time).\nMusic aside, Brzozowski\u2019s two biggest passions are sports and aviation. Rafa\u0142 won a bronze medal for his wrestling in the Academic Championships of Poland, and is currently working on upgrading his private pilot licence to an aerobatic licence.\nPerhaps Rafa\u0142 could fly to Rotterdam and offer the nearby Czech, German and Danish participants the opportunity to join him on The Ride?\nPoland at the Eurovision Song Contest\nPoland\u2019s biggest success to date is their debut entry To nie ja! (It Wasn\u2019t Me!) by Edyta G\u00f3rniak, runner-up at the 1994 Contest in Dublin. That silver medal remains a highlight in the country\u2019s Eurovision history, with Blue Caf\u00e9\u2019s Love Song (2004) and Micha\u0142 Szpak\u2019s Color of Your Life (2016) their only other top ten finishes.\nThe nation has enjoyed more success at Junior Eurovision winning the competition on two successive occasions. Roksana W\u0119giel took the crown in 2018 with Anyone I Want to Be, before passing it on to Viki Gabor in 2019 when she won with her entry Superhero.\nCan RAFA\u0141 bring some of that Polish Junior success across to May\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest?", "original_url": "https://eurovision.tv/story/rafal-the-ride", "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210312125355/https://eurovision.tv/story/rafal-the-ride", "a_id": "Q9302874-0"}
